# v0.8.10-alpha — Development Version 219

This release covers Development Versions 190–219 and introduces the complete planar 3D layer/camera workflow, animated camera and XYZ motion-path authoring, hardware depth and transparent compositing, keyframe-safe hierarchy changes, 3D masks/effects/motion blur, unified Vector3 Timeline/Graph Editor rows, performance/cache/threading audits, schema-6 migration recovery, and the automated source/smoke/full/stress test suite.

# Development Version 219 — Automated Test Suite and Render Hot-Path Repair

- Fixed the Development Version 218 editor render-time regression caused by copying full opaque JSON payloads with every Title/Layer render snapshot.
- Replaced raw passthrough strings with immutable shared storage and kept replacement value-like through copy-on-write assignment.
- Removed passthrough JSON parsing/deep merging from `layer_render_fingerprint()` and other render-fingerprint work.
- Added a native hot-path regression test for multi-megabyte passthrough payloads and thousands of snapshot copies.
- Added a versioned test-suite manifest covering GUI, Timeline/Graph Editor, serialization, rendering, cache/threading, audio, cue persistence, external data, shutdown lifetime, and platform build contracts.
- Added deterministic `source`, `smoke`, `full`, and `stress` profiles with manifest validation, timeouts, fail-fast support, CTest integration, and JSON reporting.
- Advanced the runtime and migration ledger to Development Version 219 without changing title schema 6.

# Development Version 218 — Serialization and Migration Audit

- Reuses the complete Canvas layer context menu from normal Timeline layer rows and applies it to the synchronized selected-layer set.
- Preserves Timeline multi-selection on right-click and keeps keyframe, transition, property, camera, and camera-switch context menus specialized.
- Raises the authored title schema to version 6 and extends the contiguous development migration ledger through 218.
- Preserves unknown/newer JSON fields through actual model round-trips at title, layer, camera, animated-property, keyframe, effect, transition, audio-effect, proxy, and external-provider levels.
- Isolates malformed nested cameras, effects, transitions, audio effects, bindings, sources, and fields instead of rejecting the complete title.
- Disables malformed parent-bind matrices without baking or changing transform keyframes.
- Repairs missing/duplicate layer IDs, dangling/self hierarchy links, mask references, and group/transform-parent cycles deterministically.
- Adds bounded detailed migration/recovery logs while retaining atomic `QSaveFile` persistence and best-effort future-schema loading.

# Development Version 217 — Performance, Cache and Threading Audit

- Colors active Graph Editor X/Y/Z/W and A/R/G/B toggles with the same component colors used by their curves.
- Highlights the exact 3D gizmo axis, plane, or rotation ring under the mouse before click.
- Reuses projected gizmo geometry between hit-testing and paint and invalidates it with Canvas overlay state.
- Replaces per-frame cache-state scans with an indexed title/frame aggregate.
- Batches Timeline cache-state reads and static-frame visual hashing once per visible paint range.
- Adds debug counters for queue peak, render/readback duration, UI coalescing, cache indexing, Timeline inspection, gizmo cache efficiency, and active background jobs.
- Retains worker cancellation, dirty-region invalidation, asynchronous decode/render/write/readback, and shutdown resource-release contracts.
- Adds no authored fields; title schema version 5 and Development Version 216 parent-bind data remain compatible.

# Development Version 216 — 3D Pipeline Completion and Keyframe-Safe Parenting

- Replaces all sampled reparent baking with one static 4×4 parent-bind matrix evaluated at the parenting playhead.
- Keeps authored Position, Scale, Rotation, Orientation, temporal easing, spatial tangents, roving metadata, and keyframe count unchanged during Group, Ungroup, Add/Remove from Group, Transform Parent, and parent deletion operations.
- Applies the same effective parent basis in the editor, Canvas hit-testing/manipulation, 2D compatibility compositor, projected 3D renderer, masks, mattes, group depth, motion blur, effects, and overlays.
- Preserves the existing opaque/transparent hardware-depth ordering, destination-aware blend fallback, offscreen group boundaries, effect-space separation, projected bounds, near-plane clipping, and perspective/orthographic parity.
- Adds validated Development Version 216 serialization for the optional finite parent-bind matrix. Older titles load with identity binding.
- Includes parent binding in visual hashes and bumps disk/GPU renderer ABI identities so hierarchy changes cannot reuse stale cache frames.

# Development Version 215 — Timeline and Graph Editor Completion

- Graph keyframes move at sub-frame precision by default; Ctrl/Command explicitly snaps time and values.
- X/Y/Z/W and A/R/G/B channel changes preserve the current keyframe selection.
- Four-channel scalar groups now use the same expanded rows in Layer List, Timeline, and Graph Editor.
- Double-click creates a keyframe on an empty property row and opens Keyframe Velocity on an existing temporal key.
- Copy/cut/paste/delete are available from both Timeline and Graph Editor context menus.
- A single-property clipboard can target the active compatible property, including Vector2/Vector3 conversion.
- Pasting at an occupied time replaces the existing key rather than creating duplicate timestamps.
- Camera switching, camera assignment, and projection switching retain discrete Hold semantics while sharing the common clipboard and undo paths.
- No serialized fields were added; the authored serialization schema remains Development Version 212.

# v0.8.9-alpha — Development Version 214

## Development Version 214.3 — Keyframed Group Reparent Fix

- Treats one-key and constant transform tracks as a static parent basis instead of triggering an unnecessary animated reparent bake.
- Extends the lossless whole-track offset fast path to static 3D translation-only group and transform-parent changes.
- Caps the true animated-basis fallback at 64 total samples, regardless of title duration, while retaining authored key times.
- Collapses constant generated transform channels after fallback conversion so Position-only compensation cannot create hundreds of Scale, Rotation, Orientation, or Z keys.
- Adds slow-group frame counts and the child with the largest transform-keyframe track to the one-second GPU grouping diagnostics.
- Keeps the Development Version 214 runtime label and Development Version 212 serialization schema unchanged.

- Reworked FPS diagnostics into one exact elapsed one-second sampling window for true average FPS and render cost.
- Audited coordinate writes so canvas/world geometry is converted back into effective parent-local Position for manipulation, alignment, distribution, and hierarchy changes.
- Added full-track 2D/3D Position conversion and world-preserving animated reparent/group operations.
- Removed the unbounded per-project-frame reparent bake that could make the editor crawl after grouping an animated layer.
## Development Version 214.2 — Animated Group Render Performance and Diagnostics

- Skips the pre-effects silhouette render unless the Group has an enabled effect that actually affects layers behind.
- Reuses two persistent per-group full-canvas GPU ping-pong targets instead of creating and destroying three texrender surfaces on every group render.
- Publishes the existing ping/pong result directly when possible and performs a final copy only when a mask/effect returns an external shared target.
- Adds one-second aggregate GPU group diagnostics with call count, average/maximum render time, child count, target creations, silhouette passes, and surface size.
- Adds dedicated **Grouping** and **Coordinates** logging categories plus command-level timings for Group, Ungroup, Add to Group, and Remove from Group.
- Keeps the Development Version 214 runtime label and Development Version 212 serialization schema unchanged.

## Development Version 214.1 — Animated Group Reparent Performance Fix

- Preserves animated Position tracks directly when moving layers into or out of static translation-only groups, retaining the original keyframes, temporal easing, spatial tangents, and roving metadata.
- Replaces the previous project-frame-rate bake with authored key times plus bounded 12 Hz adaptive samples only when the source or destination parent basis is itself animated.
- Caps generated adaptive samples at 512 while never discarding authored transform key times.
- Applies the same no-bake fast path to Transform Parent assignment and normal ungrouping.
- Keeps the Development Version 214 runtime label and Development Version 212 serialization schema unchanged.

## Development Version 214 — Unified Editor Data Model and Coordinate Audit

- Updates the footer once per second from one elapsed-time diagnostics window. FPS is the number of successfully presented playback frames divided by the actual window duration; average render time is computed from the frames rendered in that same window.
- Removes the diagnostics callback's unconditional Timeline repaint, avoiding a periodic update unrelated to authored or playback state.
- Establishes one coordinate contract: Transform panel values and keyframes are layer-local relative to the effective group/transform parent; Local, Parent, and World select gizmo-axis orientation only.
- Audits grouping, ungrouping, add/remove group, transform-parent assignment, and parent deletion so reparenting preserves the full evaluated world-space animation instead of only the current frame.
- Uses exact whole-track offsets for static translation-only basis changes. Only animated parent bases use bounded adaptive samples, while authored transform key times are always retained.
- Adds no-op guards so choosing an already active parent cannot rebake or alter a track.
- Routes post-mutation selection through the shared Canvas/Layer List/Timeline synchronization path and retains the existing shared flattened layer/property row model.
- Clarifies the UI with **Local Position** and **Local Axes / Parent Axes / World Axes** labels and explanatory tooltips.
- Keeps the authored Development Version 212 serialization schema unchanged; existing transform fields are reused and no migration is required.

# v0.8.9-alpha — Development Version 213

## Development Version 213 — Editor Stability and Interaction Consistency

- Stops the precise monitor-rate GUI refresh timer whenever the editor is idle and starts it only during explicit pointer interaction.
- Moves stopped-transport clock/ticker invalidation to a bounded 10 Hz timer instead of refreshing at the monitor rate.
- Restricts the application-wide event filter to the Title Editor and its native canvas window, so unrelated OBS docks and controls cannot suspend editor presentation.
- Routes Canvas, Layer List, and Timeline selection through one guarded synchronization path with no-op setters in every view.
- Makes empty-canvas context menus target-specific so stale selected layers cannot receive unintended actions.
- Resolves the **E** shortcut conflict by reserving it for the 3D Rotate gizmo while the canvas has focus and retaining Free Transform elsewhere.
- Adds aggregated Timeline paint profiling plus editor layout and panel-refresh trace diagnostics.
- Keeps the authored Development Version 212 serialization schema unchanged.

## Development Version 212.3.1 — Editor Event-Filter Compile Fix

- Declares the watched QWidget derived from the event-filter QObject before shortcut-scope routing uses it.
- Reuses the validated widget pointer inside the shortcut block instead of performing a second cast.
- Adds a regression guard ensuring the declaration remains before `watched_in_editor`.
- Does not change serialization, editor behavior, or the Development Version 212 authored schema.


## Development Version 212.3 — Editor Usability and Frame Pacing

- Measures editor playback FPS from successful project-rate swapchain presentations instead of render preparation calls.
- Separates render-cost statistics from playback FPS timing, preventing idle time and editing work from contaminating the live FPS value.
- Uses a fractional floor/ceil timer cadence so 60, 59.94, and 29.97 fps transports do not run slowly because of permanent integer rounding.
- Gives ordinary canvas Move, Rotate, and Resize gestures monitor-cadence priority, matching the established 3D gizmo and editor-camera paths.
- Restricts the spatial-keyframe context menu to a direct keyframe-handle hit; right-clicking a motion-path segment now consistently opens the layer context menu.
- Limits the 90 ms layout-settle suppression to the main window and actual dock structure events instead of every descendant control resize/layout request.
- Places the 3D View, gizmo, framing, depth, and normals controls directly after Adaptive in the main canvas toolbar.
- Adds sampling tolerance to the FPS warning color to prevent normal timing jitter from flashing the footer red.
- Retains Development Version 212 serialization and the existing 2D/3D render compatibility boundaries.

## Development Version 212.2 — Shared Layer-List and Timeline Vector3 Rows

- Replaced the widget-local Vector3 disclosure set with title-owned shared disclosure state.
- The layer list and TimelineWidget now consume one flattened `timeline_rows()` model.
- Expanding Position, Scale, Rotation, Orientation, Anchor, camera Position, or Point of Interest inserts the same X/Y/Z rows into both panes.
- Collapsing the property removes the same rows from both panes immediately.
- Channel rows use the same 28 px height as timeline rows, preserving exact vertical alignment and shared scrolling.
- Timeline keyframe hit-testing and row selection now target X, Y, Z, or All in the Graph Editor according to the clicked row.
- Added a row-count invariant and regression contract preventing the layer list and timeline from diverging again.
- The disclosure state is persisted without changing the authored animation schema or the legacy 2D rendering path.

## Development Version 212.1 — Layer-List Vector3 Channels and Graph Targeting

- Keeps one aggregate Position, Scale, Rotation, Orientation, Anchor, camera Position, and camera Point-of-Interest row while adding a disclosure caret only to properties with multiple channels.
- Expands multi-channel rows into editable X, Y, and Z child rows in the layer list, including the previously missing 3D Rotation and Orientation channels.
- Makes the aggregate row an **All** Graph Editor target and each child row a direct X/Y/Z target.
- Adds exclusive X, Y, Z, and All channel toggles to the Graph Editor toolbar.
- Draws all three vector curves together in All mode and applies relative vertical keyframe edits to every component; single-channel mode edits only the selected component.
- Promotes the legacy-named `AnimatedVec2Property` compatibility facade to full X/Y/Z Graph Editor access without changing its serialized compatibility contract or the 2D affine renderer.
- Initially kept the normal timeline as one row per property; Development Version 212.2 supersedes that UI limitation with synchronized expandable X/Y/Z rows while retaining one authored keyframe track.
- Requires no schema migration: the authored Vector3 storage remains Development Version 212 and old 2D projects continue to load with their established Z defaults.


## Development Version 212 — Unified Vector3, Camera Timeline Visibility, and Direct Keyframe Synchronization

- Expands the legacy `Vec2Value` and `AnimatedVec2Property` storage contract to XYZ while preserving their public names as source/serialization compatibility facades.
- Reads pre-212 XY-only JSON with field-specific Z defaults, merges legacy `position_z`, `scale_z`, and `anchor_z` key times into unified vector tracks, and continues to save the old scalar mirrors for backward compatibility.
- Leaves the legacy 2D affine rendering path untouched; Z is ignored for 2D layers, so old 2D projects retain their historical output.
- Includes Z in spatial interpolation, tangent math, velocity, cache identity, sampled animation signatures, serialization, copy/paste, and undo/redo payloads.
- Replaces separate transform-axis timeline rows with one aggregate Position, Scale, Rotation, Anchor, or Orientation row; old unsynchronized axis keyframes are represented through a union of their key times.
- Makes a clicked timeline property row or keyframe the active Graph Editor target without requiring a separate layer-list selection step.
- Refreshes layer-list disclosure rows immediately after timeline paste/delete and refreshes the timeline immediately after layer-list keyframe changes, including removal of the final keyframe.
- Hides the implicit default camera until it has authored keyframes, while custom cameras remain visible and expose their full property set when expanded.
- Adds Camera to the Add Layer menu; a newly created custom camera receives a stable ID/name and becomes the active render camera at the current playhead.


## Development Version 211 — Compatibility and Regression Completion

- Preserves pixel-identical legacy 2D rendering by retaining the historical affine path whenever neither a layer nor its ancestors use 3D.
- Replaces the editor's selective undo restore list with a complete deep authored-title snapshot, covering cameras, camera switches, all layer/camera 3D properties, Live Text Cue authoring, scene-mask state, audio layers, persistence settings, imports, and future title fields automatically.
- Preserves runtime title identity, editor camera override, proxy metadata, cue/playlist playback state, and persistence-transition state while restoring authored undo/redo snapshots, then forces an authoritative GPU refresh and deferred cache invalidation.
- Validates preserved Live Text Cue runtime rows against the restored authored table, clamps playlist indices, and normalizes persistent-column state so undoing cue-table edits cannot leave out-of-range runtime references.
- Forces editor audio runtime publication and a discontinuity-aware transport sync after undo/redo, including when the playhead itself did not move.
- Adds Duplicate Camera, Copy Camera, and Paste Camera actions that preserve complete animated camera properties and generate safe IDs/names.
- Extends layer clipboard payloads with referenced camera definitions and remaps static and keyframed camera assignments during cross-title paste or when a same-title source camera was deleted after copying.
- Keeps title import/export portable by stripping machine-specific proxy metadata, editor render-camera overrides, and active cue/playlist runtime state while retaining authored layer and camera IDs needed by masks, parenting, bindings, and camera assignments.
- Adds a consolidated Version 211 compatibility contract and expands the title snapshot unit test to cover complete 3D/camera restoration plus runtime-state isolation.
- Documents automated and manual regression gates for proxy/prerender, persistence, Live Text Cues, scene masks, synchronized audio, shutdown, leak detection, and repeated editor open/close cycles.


## Development Version 210 — Performance, Cache, and Rendering Audit

- Presents active 3D Move, Rotate, and Scale updates at monitor cadence while reusing resident layer rasters and updating only the evaluated GPU transform snapshot.
- Rejects duplicate pointer coordinates before animation properties, model revisions, or render scheduling are touched.
- Keeps a single coalesced render request, leaves full raster/layout work cost-aware, and preserves transport-driven timeline playback.
- Treats keyframe insertion, deletion, interpolation changes, and post-drag geometry publication as authoritative model boundaries. A full GPU snapshot is guaranteed before transform-only updates can resume.
- Gives the exact post-release frame realtime scheduling priority without carrying transform-only state through `layer_geometry_changed()` or `refresh_preview()`.
- Bypasses stale final-frame cache submission while an authoritative editor model refresh is pending, without clearing or mutating the independent OBS/RAM/disk prerender cache.
- Adds source contracts for realtime pacing, bounded scheduling, cache isolation, and the keyframe-after-transform regression.


## Development Version 209 — Camera-Aware 3D Motion Blur

- Evaluates every temporal sample through the full 3D parent hierarchy and the active or layer-assigned camera.
- Covers XYZ translation, rotation/orientation, perspective scale changes, parent/grandparent animation and camera orbit, rotation and dolly movement.
- Measures projected screen-space travel at five shutter times using corners, edge midpoints and centre points for stable adaptive sampling.
- Raises the real-time temporal sample budget only for projected 3D motion while preserving the existing 2D budget.
- Keeps static projected layers pixel-identical through the zero-travel early-out, preventing stationary smears and alpha halos.
- Uses the same output path in the editor, OBS, prerender and cache.

This release consolidates the work completed after `v0.8.8-alpha` Development Version 144: first-class audio layers and editor monitoring, native OBS Stinger transitions, Scene A/B animation, serialization and migration hardening, cache/prerender scheduling improvements, live cue transition persistence, and broad cross-platform regression coverage.


## Development Version 208 — Full 3D Spatial Motion Paths

- Added a unified `AnimatedVec3Property` and `Vector3Keyframe` model for genuine XYZ position paths, including complete temporal velocity metadata, incoming/outgoing 3D tangents, linked tangent state, spatial interpolation mode, and roving state.
- Promoted 3D layer Position and camera Position/Point of Interest to shared Vector3 tracks while retaining the legacy XY/Z and scalar camera channels as compatibility mirrors for older documents and unpromoted content.
- Added separate X, Y, and Z Value/Speed Graph Editor channels backed by one shared 3D keyframe sequence, so temporal and spatial interpolation are edited together without duplicating keyframes.
- Added Linear, Auto Bezier, Continuous Bezier, and Manual Bezier spatial interpolation, true 3D handle dragging through the active camera, curve-preserving segment insertion, and distance-based roving keyframes.
- Extended timeline copy/paste, move, delete, easing, and undo/redo operations to preserve the complete 3D keyframe payload.
- Projected parent-space paths through each keyframe's evaluated parent hierarchy into world/camera space, and extended Frame Selected to include the complete selected motion path.
- Added serialization, migration, cache hashing, animation classification, runtime tests, and source contracts for the new Vector3 tracks.
- Preserved the anchor-stable projected-content path and all mask, depth, effect, and compositor behavior from Development Version 207.


## Development Version 207 — Camera Timeline and Animation

- Rebuilt the camera-animation delivery directly from the clean Development Version 206 source instead of layering fixes over the earlier 207 revisions.
- Added a collapsed **Camera Switches** owner row and collapsed per-camera rows to the timeline. Camera channels appear only when their AE-style disclosure caret is opened.
- Exposed Position XYZ, Point of Interest XYZ, Orientation XYZ, Rotation XYZ, focal length, field of view, zoom, near/far clipping, and Projection channels to the timeline and shared Value/Speed Graph Editor.
- Added discrete Hold-keyframe tracks for active-camera switching and per-layer camera assignment, including selection, drag, copy/paste, deletion, and undo/redo through the established timeline command path.
- Added serialization and migration for camera orientation, projection mode, camera switching, and layer camera assignment while retaining the legacy static mirrors used by existing projects.
- Preserved the Development Version 206 render baseline for every unkeyed camera: static selection, static assignment, static projection, 3D text rasterization, projected bounds, preview scaling, and layer presentation are unchanged. New camera evaluators are used only for authored animation tracks.
- Fixed long-standing 3D content pulsation with non-centred anchors. Fallback artwork now fits its projective transform from the real texture rectangle to the exact projected local raster corners, matching the already-stabilized bounding-box path instead of extrapolating a unit-square homography.
- Extended animation detection and cache identity only for actual camera/switch/assignment keyframes; opening or navigating camera rows does not invalidate rendered content.
- Kept full XYZ spatial motion paths and 3D spatial Bezier editing scoped to Development Version 208.


## Development Version 206 — Masks, blend modes, and effects in 3D

- Added a stable effect-space contract: ordinary artwork effects run in padded layer space before projection, Motion Blur runs from projected transform samples, and affect-layers-behind effects remain screen-space destination passes.
- Allowed compatible 3D planes with layer-space effects and projected track mattes to enter the hardware depth pass.
- Evaluated track matte alpha/luma/clipping coverage in screen space during the same projected depth draw, preventing masked-out pixels from writing invisible Z.
- Projected complete padded effect-raster bounds through the camera with homogeneous frustum clipping, preserving shadow, glow, blur, and outline extents after perspective rotation and safely rejecting fully off-camera surfaces.
- Kept non-Normal blend modes in the destination-aware full-frame ping-pong compositor while ordering compatible contiguous 3D fallback surfaces by camera depth.
- Preserved groups as offscreen compositing boundaries: compatible children resolve internal depth before the flattened group receives its own mask, effects, opacity, and blend mode.
- Preserved OBS scene-mask insertion at the real layer-stack position and kept scene-mask effects in the full-canvas post-projection path.
- Replaced unbounded projected selection/hover coordinates with homogeneous frustum-clipped polygons and visibility-tested handles, eliminating flicker when a 3D bounding box crosses the canvas or near plane.
- Retained the MSVC C2601 correction by keeping `PropertiesPanel::apply_anchor_preset()` at file scope outside the constructor include chain.
- Added Development Version 206 source contracts for mask/depth coupling, effect-space classification, blend/group ordering, projected effect bounds, scene masks, and stable 3D overlays. No project schema change was required.


## Development Version 205 — Compact 3D properties, stable overlays, and full group parenting

- Made Layer Properties denser across Transform, Character, Paragraph, Shape, Image, and Text Animator sections, with smaller labels, numeric fields, spacing, and controls.
- Placed scale/aspect lock controls consistently after the complete numeric value set, including XYZ Scale, shape Size, and image-box Size rows.
- Moved the layer anchor preset control out of Layer Properties and into the context-sensitive dynamic editor toolbar while retaining the existing compensation, keyframe, and undo paths.
- Converted the 3D Camera inspector to a persistent collapsible header and made its Position, Target, Rotation, focal-length, FOV, zoom, and clipping labels draggable for numeric editing.
- Stabilized projected 3D selection and hover bounds with solid cosmetic outlines plus device-pixel-aligned overlay geometry, removing dash-phase/subpixel flicker without quantizing rendered artwork.
- Added full XYZ world-transform snapshots for grouping, ungrouping, transform-parent changes, group removal, and deletion. Reparenting into or out of a 3D hierarchy now computes the new local TRS while preserving the visible world transform.
- Defined 2D children under 3D parents as strict local XY planes that inherit the complete parent basis but ignore stale local Z/Rotation-X/Y channels until explicitly promoted to 3D.
- Extended hardware depth and deterministic transparent ordering to compatible sibling planes inside nested groups before each group boundary is flattened for its own masks/effects.
- Advanced development metadata and the contiguous no-schema-change migration ledger to Development Version 205.


## Development Version 204 — AE-style 3D layer UI and transparent compositing

- Added a final **2D/3D** toggle to every compatible layer-list row; audio and adjustment layers expose a disabled 2D state.
- Reworked the Transform panel so enabling 3D expands Position, Scale and Anchor from XY to XYZ in place, presents Rotation as X/Y/Z, adds Orientation X/Y/Z, and keeps every Z field at the end of its owning row.
- Unified each visible XYZ control behind one keyframe diamond and one context-menu action while preserving separate X/Y/Z graph channels and the existing serialized XY-plus-Z schema.
- Added a migration-safe `LayerVector3Value` facade used by the shared editor/OBS 3D transform evaluator.
- Added a dedicated transparent 3D pass after opaque depth rendering. Compatible planes are sorted far-to-near by camera depth, with authored layer order as the stable coplanar tie-break.
- Transparent layers with **Write Depth** disabled retain color without contaminating later Z tests; explicitly depth-writing transparent layers participate in persistent depth according to their per-layer settings.
- Kept masked, effected, grouped, custom-blend, motion-blurred and Transition Input layers on the established compatibility compositor.
- Advanced development metadata and the contiguous no-schema-change migration ledger to Development Version 204.


## Development Version 203 — Depth, culling, and material semantics

- Made **Depth Test** and **Write Depth** independent for compatible simple opaque root-level 3D planes instead of requiring both controls to be enabled.
- Added persistent depth writers with `LEQUAL` testing, plus `ALWAYS` writers for layers that intentionally write depth without testing existing Z.
- Added authored-order read-only depth evaluation for **Depth Test enabled / Write Depth disabled** layers. Each such layer tests only against persistent depth already written at its position, then restores that depth without contaminating later layers.
- Changed backface classification to use final screen-space projected winding and retained a world-space plane normal, keeping culling predictable under negative X/Y scale, parent mirroring, perspective, and orthographic projection.
- Added editor-only **Depth** and **Normals** diagnostics showing projected camera depth, depth-state combinations, front/back classification, culled faces, and world-normal direction without changing final output or cache identity.
- Added explanatory tooltips, Development Version 203 migration continuity, and dedicated source contracts for the new depth/culling behavior.


## Development Version 202 — Hardware depth-buffer core

- Added an optional persistent `GS_Z24_S8` render target for compatible opaque 3D runs containing at least two planes; unsupported backends and single-plane runs retain the established compositor.
- Added real per-pixel depth testing with `GS_LEQUAL`, perspective/orthographic camera projection, and shared world matrices for editor/OBS parity.
- Added an alpha-clipped depth shader so fully transparent raster pixels do not occlude geometry behind them.
- Split depth runs whenever the effective render camera changes and retained the authored compatibility compositor around every non-compatible layer.
- Kept masks, effects, motion blur, custom blend modes, groups, transparency, Transition Input layers, and depth-disabled layers on the established texture-compositing path.
- Added runtime resource cleanup, Development Version 202 migration continuity, and a dedicated hardware-depth source contract.


## Development Version 201 — Editor 3D views, navigation, and transform gizmos

- Added an editor-only camera override that cannot be serialized, cached as title content, or propagated to OBS output.
- Added Active Camera, Front, Back, Left, Right, Top, Bottom, and Custom Perspective views.
- Added orbit, pan, dolly/zoom, Frame Selected, and Frame All navigation with persistent per-editor view state.
- Added Move, Rotate, and Scale 3D gizmos with X/Y/Z axes, plane handles, Local/Parent/World orientation, snapping modifiers, multi-selection updates, and the existing editor undo/redo transaction path.
- Added a dedicated 3D control bar and W/E/R, F, and Shift+F shortcuts.
- Kept cached final frames disabled only while an editor camera override is active, without invalidating the title's final-output cache.


## Development Version 200 — MSVC camera inspector compile repair

- Fixed the camera-control enable/disable loop in `title-properties-panel.cpp` by explicitly normalizing every `QDoubleSpinBox*` to `QWidget*`; this avoids MSVC `std::initializer_list` deduction errors C3535/C2440.
- Synchronized CMake, runtime build information, serialization development metadata, package examples, and version contracts to Development Version 200.
- Added explicit no-schema-change migration steps for Development Versions 191–200 so migration reporting remains contiguous.


## Development Version 190 — Planar 3D transform foundation and cameras

- Added opt-in 3D mode for compatible visual layers while preserving the exact legacy 2D path for old projects.
- Added Position Z, Rotation X/Y/Z, Scale Z, Anchor Z, Orientation XYZ, transform-space selection, per-layer camera assignment, depth controls, double-sided rendering, and backface culling.
- Added a shared editor/OBS projective transform evaluator, full 3D parent inheritance, perspective and orthographic title cameras, a default canvas-matching camera, and camera editing controls.
- Added conservative opaque-plane depth sorting for the flattened compositor while preserving authored ordering for 2D, transparent, masked, effected, blended, and depth-disabled layers; hardware Z-buffer compositing remains a follow-up.
- Connected all 3D channels to timeline keyframes, temporal interpolation, animation detection, transform-only refresh, motion-blur travel, serialization, migration, content hashes, and cache invalidation.
- Added a maintained 3D coordinate/effect-ordering guide with explicit development boundaries and a standalone layer-3D source contract.

## Development Version 189 — Disabled FX stack indicator and documentation consolidation

- Layer rows retain their FX badge when an effect stack is bypassed and draw a diagonal strike-through over it. Re-enabling the stack removes the strike immediately.
- Preserved the independent external-data binding dot/label behavior on the same layer indicator.
- Bumped the public version to `v0.8.9-alpha` and the delivery revision to Development Version 189 across CMake, runtime metadata, dependency metadata, package examples, tests, and audits.
- Rewrote the root README around the current feature set and grouped release additions since Development Version 144.
- Merged Text Animator documentation into the text/live-data guide, merged testing and validation guidance into the architecture guide, and removed obsolete root-level per-delivery reports.

# Development Version 188 — Audio mixer visibility and reverse editor audio

- Title sources now call OBS audio-active state dynamically: only titles with
  an Audio layer appear as devices in the Audio Mixer.
- Mixer visibility is re-evaluated when the bound title or its layer structure
  changes, without recreating the OBS source.
- The editor monitored preview now publishes its exact playhead and playback
  direction to the private title source.
- Reverse playback mixes decoded audio samples in descending sample order,
  including editor reverse handling for independent audio layers.
- Direction changes are transport discontinuities so scheduler state and DSP
  history are reset cleanly at reverse/forward boundaries.

# Development Version 187 — Live cue transition persistence and cache performance

- Unified live cue persistence timing for keyframes and transitions, including manual uncue and row-to-row persistence states.
- Made cache visual-state deduplication persistence-aware.
- Batched cache queue construction, added constant-time queued-key lookup, deferred background ordering, and added a realtime/urgent lane that preempts background work without full-queue sorting.
- Converted RAM frame-cache LRU maintenance from linear scans to constant-time list operations.
- Moved disk frame hydration entirely to the cache worker for editor and OBS realtime requests; bounded disk persistence is now nonblocking and best-effort under backpressure.
- Added non-blocking disk membership/usage snapshots, coalesced UI notifications, debounced prerender diagnostics, removed per-live-cue-frame sleeps, and aligned paused/interactive wake predicates with the urgent dequeue lane.
- Bumped the GPU cache ABI so stale frames created under the old persistence clock cannot be reused.
- No persisted title schema fields changed.

# Development Version 186 — Sample-locked editor audio cadence

- Analyzed the v185 runtime log and found 16 synthetic 20–21.6 ms timestamp gaps in nine seconds, with no actual monitor underrun.
- Replaced wall-clock-relative monitor deadlines with absolute sample-locked deadlines.
- Removed periodic timestamp rewrites to `now`; normal packet timestamps remain exactly contiguous.
- Added bounded catch-up for ordinary timer jitter and a 70 ms threshold for genuine hard resynchronization.
- Added deterministic Windows-oversleep regression coverage and retained the existing source-audio scheduler unchanged.

# Development Version 184 — Editor audio delivery restoration and diagnostics

- Replaced the ineffective Development Version 183 threshold-only adjustment with a real delivery-path split.
- Private editor preview audio now uses the exact Development Version 178 `video_tick` packet-submission cadence, while decode remains asynchronous and cached.
- Ordinary OBS source audio continues to use the Development Version 181 background worker and 80–160 ms buffered queue.
- The editor-preview flag is read before constructing `SourceAudioRuntime`, preventing any initial worker-mode burst.
- Added `[BGL Audio]` lifecycle, transport, decode, flow, timestamp-gap, delivery-stall, underrun and idle diagnostics to the OBS log.
- Added source contracts for single-path editor delivery and logging coverage. No serialization fields changed.

# Development Version 183 — Editor audio monitor cadence fix

- Isolated the remaining audio regression to the private editor preview source, which uses OBS monitor-only delivery rather than the normal timestamped source mixer.
- Kept the 80–160 ms queue for ordinary source output and added a dedicated 10–30 ms monitor profile with a three-block burst limit.
- Added automatic scheduler profile switching from the public OBS monitoring type, with clock reset at consumer boundaries.
- Added editor-monitor cadence regression coverage; no persisted schema fields changed.

# Development Version 182 — Windows audio worker compile fix

- Fixed MSVC C3861 in `title-audio-runtime.cpp` by removing the unavailable `os_set_thread_name()` libobs symbol.
- Added private Windows/Linux/macOS thread naming with no new link dependency and no audio-path behavior change.
- Added a portability source contract and extended the no-op serialization migration ledger to Development Version 182.

# Development Version 181 — Audio scheduler repair and automated regression pass

- Fixed the v180 intermittent/noisy audio regression after a direct v178/v180 comparison identified the dedicated output scheduler's 30 ms queue as the only material playback-path change.
- Added an 80–160 ms bounded output window, monotonic gapless timestamps, title-playhead re-anchoring after true underruns, and new audio-output debug counters.
- Kept file decode, waveform generation, audio mixing, network activity and proxy rendering outside UI/render/video threads.
- Added direct external JSON path and audio scheduler unit tests, a CTest wrapper for every Python source contract, the Development Step 100 matrix, and a complete manual regression checklist.
- Extended the serialization migration ledger to Development Version 181 without changing persisted schema.

# Development Version 180 — Performance, cache and threading audit

- Coalesced provider and render-publication bursts by source/field key, with a minimum frame-sized publication window.
- Added bounded compiled formatting-pattern caching and retained canvas pattern-tile diagnostics.
- Moved audio mix/output off the OBS video tick, added cooperative decode cancellation, reusable immutable PCM/waveform assets, weak global ownership, and worker joins on source shutdown.
- Added per-title disk-write generations, stale GPU-readback cancellation, proxy-only visual-hash exclusion, and complete title-cache ownership cleanup while preserving dirty-region invalidation.
- Replaced linear Bezier segment scans with binary search and added an explicitly invalidated UI-only motion-path sample cache.
- Added debug performance counters plus new unit/source contracts for threading, caching, shutdown and migration compatibility.

## Development Version 179 — Unified Serialization and Migration Audit

- Introduced title schema version 4 with per-title `schema_version` and `development_version` fields while preserving the top-level title array used by older builds.
- Added a contiguous Development Version 144–179 migration ledger and idempotent current-schema validation.
- Added validation/recovery for external sources and bindings, rich-text formatting profiles and pattern rules, audio layers, Stinger settings, proxy metadata, Bezier handles, and dock collapse/splitter state.
- Unknown or unavailable external providers now load disabled; missing audio and stale/broken proxy files remain non-fatal.
- Existing non-empty layer IDs are never regenerated during migration or template import.
- Style presets, Auto Styling rule sets, title templates, per-title store entries, and proxy manifests now carry schema metadata where applicable; title/preset/profile writes and manifest rewrites use atomic replacement.
- Added JSON migration round-trip tests and a unified source contract covering every audited feature.

## Development Version 173 — Full Scene A/B layer contract

- Manual Scene A/B inputs now support the same trim, temporal move, keyframes, transitions, hierarchy, rename, copy/duplicate, masks and effects workflows as ordinary shape/image layers.
- Removed the special fixed-duration timeline path and all automatic reapplication of full-duration timing.
- Required A/B layers are protected only from deletion. Duplicates are ordinary deletable scene-input layers.
- Existing authored geometry, timing, effects, transitions, hierarchy and ordering are preserved.
- Newly created required A/B layers start at full canvas size and full title duration.

## Development Version 172 — Shape-like Scene A/B layers

- Scene A/B transition inputs now use the same Size-backed rectangular geometry and resize behavior as shape layers.
- Live OBS scene textures map 1:1 into the current authored A/B layer box rather than inheriting placeholder-raster crop metadata.
- Runtime A/B effects and mask graphs use the layer's real local geometry while remaining non-cacheable per transition frame.
- Switch-at-point mode continues to hide A/B system layers from canvas selection and bounding boxes.

## Development Version 171 — Stinger A/B layer visibility, surfaces, and duration fixes

- Hid Scene A/B system layers from canvas selection, hit testing, hover, and bounding boxes whenever Switch at Point mode is active.
- Corrected manual mode defaults to two full-canvas 1:1 surfaces, with Scene B below Scene A and no implicit transition-point opacity cut.
- Added deterministic migration for the exact generated v168-v170 A/B defaults and fixed their timeline strips to the document animation range.

## Development Version 169 — Stinger Qt keyword compile fix

- Fixed the MSVC syntax-error cascade in `title-data.cpp` caused by using `slots` as a local variable while Qt keyword macros are enabled.
- Renamed the local transition-input container and loop identifiers to unambiguous names.
- Added a regression test for Qt macro-safe compilation of the Stinger A/B layer block.

## Development Version 168 — Stinger switch modes and animatable Scene A/B inputs

- Added Switch at Point and Manual Scene Animation modes to Stinger documents.
- Added editor-only Scene A/Scene B canvas preview backgrounds for point-switch Stingers, with Scene A selected by default for newly created Stingers.
- Added protected, persistent Scene A and Scene B runtime input layers in manual mode. Both participate in transforms, keyframes, masks, mattes, blend modes, and effects, but cannot be renamed, duplicated, grouped, or deleted.
- Kept A/B placeholder surfaces editor-only; ordinary OBS title sources render them transparent, while the native manual transition binds the live OBS scene textures.
- Bound the real OBS transition textures to those layers through the native `obs_transition_video_render()` callback and the unified BGL GPU compositor.
- Marked manual Scene A/B composition as dynamic for cache/proxy validation and added cache-key coverage for switch mode and transition-input identity.
- Synchronized CMake and runtime development-version metadata to 168.

## Development Version 164 — Stinger dock icon compile fix

- Fixed the undeclared `title` identifier in `TitleDock::populate_list()` by using the loop's current `t` title object when composing list-view status icons.
- Added a source contract to prevent the scope regression from returning.
- Synchronized CMake and runtime development-version metadata to 164.

## Development Version 150 — Audio layer UI and effect routing

- Added audio-specific layer controls, group dual eye/speaker controls, Audio Effects catalog/settings integration, and audio/visual compatibility routing.

## Development Version 144 — v0.8.8-alpha and Character panel cleanup

- Bumped the public plugin version from `v0.8.7-alpha` to `v0.8.8-alpha` across CMake, compile-time/runtime metadata, vcpkg metadata, installation/package examples, tests, audits, and canonical documentation.
- Removed the Font and Style labels from the Character properties section and made both combo boxes span the complete available panel width, preserving expansion under narrow and wide inspector layouts.
- Added consolidated README release notes covering the major changes completed since `v0.8.7-alpha` Development Version 107.

## Development Version 143 — Keyframe authoring, Graph Editor modifiers, and matte-column cleanup

- Removed the obsolete legacy Easing submenu from keyframe context menus. Temporal Interpolation is now the sole authoring UI and is also available directly from animated-property rows in the layer list, including Linear, Hold, Auto/Continuous/Manual Bezier, Easy Ease variants, and Keyframe Velocity.
- Made layer-list keyframe controls playhead-aware: diamonds indicate whether the current frame contains a key, numeric fields display evaluated animated values, edits write at the active playhead, and fields use the plugin's normal palette, border, hover, focus, selection, and disabled states.
- Added live Graph Editor drag modifiers: Shift constrains keyframes, handles, and panning to the dominant axis; Ctrl/Command snaps keyframe time/value and handle influence/speed; Alt continues to break linked temporal handles.
- Replaced the Graph Editor toolbar glyph with the supplied `graph.svg`, normalized to `currentColor`, and restored a visible, interactive time ruler and playhead marker above the graph.
- Renamed the layer-list Matte header to Matte Source and consolidated matte source/destination role indicators into one column headed by the matte-destination glyph.

## Development Version 142 — Synchronized keyframe sections and layer-list icon refresh

- Unified layer-list and timeline keyframe-section expansion behind one shared predicate, including the three-state Group caret. Animated property rows now appear and disappear in both panels together.
- Removed the timeline-only aggregate keyframe markers and hit targets from collapsed layer strips, eliminating the state where keyframes were visible in the timeline while their layer-list section was closed.
- Replaced the layer-list lock, unlock, hidden-visibility, matte-only, matte-source, and matte-destination artwork with the supplied SVG geometry. All supplied glyphs use `currentColor` and continue through the OBS-theme-aware icon renderer.

## Development Version 141 — Timeline strip, transition, ruler, and layer-state fixes

- Enlarged the visible layer-strip trim handles and widened their mouse hit zones, with outer strip edges taking priority over transition overlays so in/out points remain easy to resize when transitions are present.
- Made the complete area of an existing transition a valid drag-and-drop replacement target; replacement presets preserve the previous transition duration, subject only to the layer and opposite-edge limits.
- Made text-transition deletion immediately remove its managed Text Animator and generated keyframes, including stale timeline keyframe selections.
- Repainted the complete ruler band during playhead movement so time labels no longer lose their right edge for a frame as the playhead crosses them.
- Replaced normal, hidden, and matte-only layer visibility glyphs with the supplied SVG artwork and normalized it to `currentColor` for the active OBS theme. Existing lock/unlock glyphs remain routed through the same theme-aware renderer.

## Development Version 140 — Editor graph, timeline layout, and theme-aware icon fixes

- Added the supplied graph icon to the checkable Graph Editor button and made Value/Speed Graph, Fit Graphs, and Fit Selection controls visible only while Graph Editor mode is active.
- Restored shared playhead interaction in Graph Editor mode: ruler clicks/drags, loop/pause marker drags, and direct playhead-line dragging are no longer swallowed by graph hover or release handlers.
- Matched sidebar flyout long-press timing to the editor Fit control and made flyouts open horizontally toward the available side of the active screen rather than below the tool icon.
- Enforced a safe minimum layer-list width, synchronized header/row column widths, and reserved a usable minimum Layer Name column so Mode, Parent, Mask, and matte controls cannot overlap.
- Reorganized the timeline ruler into separate label, tick, and cache bands so cache progress no longer clips ruler labels and loop/pause markers remain orderly.
- Replaced the distribute, flip, matte, and Graph Editor artwork with the supplied SVGs. All supplied glyphs use `currentColor` and are rendered through the OBS-theme-aware icon pipeline.

## Development Version 139 — Text-transition glyph-envelope compile fix

- Fixed the Windows/MSVC build failure in `max_rich_text_font_height_hint()`.
- Removed invalid access to `TextLayoutPaintStyle::font_size` and `TextLayoutPaintStyle::scale_y`; paint styles intentionally contain paint-only state.
- The animation-aware glyph envelope now resolves effective `RichTextCharFormat` values at canonical rich-text range boundaries, preserving mixed font sizes and vertical scales without duplicating shaping data into paint runs.
- Added a regression contract that rejects future paint/shaping model cross-access.

## Development Version 138 — Text-transition glyph bounds and integrated blur regression fix

- Restored the proven isolated shaped-unit compositor as the primary unified Text Animator raster path. The flattened compositor is now an emergency fallback only, preventing advance/layout rectangles from clipping italic overhangs, swashes, combining marks, strokes, and overlapping glyph ink.
- Cropped transition units from their actual alpha/ink envelope and retained a transparent resampling gutter around every crop so scale, slide, rotation, filtering, and blur cannot sample against a hard image edge.
- Expanded text-layer temporary surfaces and clips using font metrics, rich-text maximum font height, plain/rich stroke width, and antialiasing slack instead of fixed approximate padding.
- Moved Text Animator blur onto the same premultiplied-pixel blur backend, blur-type pass mapping, and support-radius calculation used by the built-in BGL Blur effect. The retired transition-only blur helper is no longer present.
- Preserved radius-driven blur semantics: a unit is rendered as the blurred representation while blur is active and resolves to the sharp representation at zero, avoiding a sharp core plus halo.
- Bumped the GPU/cache visual ABI so prerenders produced by the cropped/transition-only-blur implementation cannot be reused.
- Added structural regression coverage for primary-path ordering, alpha-bound crops, transparent gutters, animation-aware ink padding, shared blur backend usage, and removal of the old transition blur helper.

## Development Version 137 — Text-transition runtime activation fix

- Fixed the broken title-source include boundary introduced in Development Version 136: the orphaned tail of the retired legacy transition function was removed from `compatibility-layer-raster.inc`, so the unified renderer is emitted at valid file scope.
- Added runtime self-healing that resolves every serialized text-transition descriptor into its bound generic `TextAnimatorStack` before cache-key generation and rendering. Descriptor-only, stale, and intermediate 134/135 titles therefore animate without requiring an editor resave.
- Routed transition-managed text through the conservative compatibility raster compositor while preserving the shared shaped layout and `TextAnimatorEvaluation`; this bypasses the unvalidated per-glyph GPU route without reviving any preset-specific transition evaluator.
- Made transition-managed raster composition use the already rendered canonical text surface first, preserving rich fill, stroke, shadow, background, emoji, and color-font appearance while applying per-unit opacity, transform, wipe, and blur.
- Added regression coverage for descriptor-only runtime recovery, include-module boundaries, managed-transition GPU fallback, and flattened-compositor routing.

## Development Version 136 — Complete unified legacy text transitions

- Restored the complete BGL text-transition authoring workflow while keeping `TextAnimatorStack` as the only runtime evaluator. Text-transition descriptors remain timeline/Transition Editor metadata and are bound to editable managed animators.
- Added the generic `Staggered` selector with exact historical two-stage easing, entrance/exit timing, reverse order, character/word/sentence units, Hold behavior, and frame-accurate layer-local keyframes.
- Converted Fade Text, Slide In/Out, Scale Text, Blur Text, Wipe Text, and Blur Slide In/Out into editable unified animators without deleting their timeline handles.
- Added stable transition binding signatures so duration/direction/editor changes update the managed animator, while unrelated refreshes and saves preserve manual animator/property/selector/keyframe edits.
- Added live synchronization while dragging transition duration and trimming layer edges.
- Restored word/sentence Scale Text behavior through generic shared-unit transform origins instead of scaling each glyph independently.
- Added directional shaped-unit clipping for Wipe Text in the common GPU glyph compositor.
- Replaced SDF edge softening with a multi-sample contracting glyph/stroke blur so Blur Text and Blur Slide no longer render as a sharp core with a glow-like halo.
- Added a generic Qt compatibility-raster adapter driven by the same shaped layout and `TextAnimatorEvaluation`, covering color fonts, emoji, unsupported glyph alpha maps, oversized atlas glyphs, and bounded long-text fallback without reviving legacy preset-specific rendering.
- Updated Transition Editor text previews to create and evaluate the same managed animator model used by editor/source output rather than duplicating stagger/easing formulas.
- Added automatic recovery of timeline transition descriptors from intermediate Development Versions 134/135 and deterministic upgrade to the current managed binding schema.
- Fixed duplicate/delete/enable lifecycle behavior for managed transition animators and added regression coverage for runtime retirement, preview parity, fallback rendering, synchronization, migration, Unicode units, cache signatures, and 1,200-cluster stress.

## Development Version 135

- Fixed the `PropertiesPanel` implementation-module order so the Text Animator member definitions are emitted at file scope instead of interrupting the constructor.
- Fixed GPU ticker Text Animator preparation to use the render session title and cue state when sampling `ticker_runtime`.
- Added `DOWNLOAD_EXTRACT_TIMESTAMP TRUE` to the nlohmann/json `FetchContent_Declare` call to remove CMake CMP0135 warnings.
- Synchronized CMake and runtime development-version metadata.

# Development version 134 — Unified Text Animator Core and Legacy Preset Migration

- Introduced a single shaped-layout-based Text Animator data/evaluation model shared by editor and source rendering.
- Added ordered animator stacks, generic properties, four selector families, selector composition, deterministic seeds, dynamic-text policies, serialization, cache signatures, and timeline discovery.
- Converted every legacy text preset identifier found in development version 133 to editable animator/property/selector/keyframe data and retained legacy loading only as a conversion layer.
- Added a Text Animators inspector and standalone `.obgtextanim` preset round-trip support.
- Added Unicode/dynamic text/migration/performance tests and `TEXT_AND_LIVE_DATA.md`.
- This revision is the shared-core integration milestone; full layout-animation, effects parity, expanded preset library, pixel fixtures, and Windows/Linux OBS runtime validation remain explicitly tracked in `TEXT_AND_LIVE_DATA.md`.

## Development Version 133 — Dock caret refinement and updated application icon

- Replaced the Titles and Graphics collapse/expand arrows with the same monochrome disclosure caret used elsewhere in the UI. The expanded header caret points down and the collapsed rail caret points right.
- Kept the docking-side-aware placement of the caret/button while leaving the disclosure direction consistent.
- Hid the compact-rail cache icon whenever aggregate cache/prerendering is disabled instead of showing a disabled cache glyph.
- Replaced the Broadcast Graphics Live application/window icon with the newly supplied brand artwork without redrawing or restyling it.
- Updated build metadata and package naming to Development Version 133.

## Development Version 132 — Collapsible Titles and Graphics Dock

- Added a header caret that collapses only the Titles and Graphics pane; Live Text Cues remains mounted and operational.
- Added a compact rail showing the Broadcast Graphics Live icon, selected-title active/inactive state, cue state, and aggregate cache/prerender status.
- Collapse is visibility/layout-only: the title list widget and model are never recreated, selection is preserved, and cue/playback/prerender state continues uninterrupted.
- Persisted collapsed state, expanded dock width, expanded splitter size, and last dock area. Carets follow left/right docking and use vertical direction while floating.
- Avoided dock-width changes during collapse to prevent OBS layout jumps; floating expansion restores the saved width.

## Development Version 123 — Structural & Invisible Character Recognition

- Extended learned regex inference to recognize paragraph/newline boundaries, CRLF, LF, CR, tabs, form feed, vertical tab, spaces, repeated spaces, and Unicode line/paragraph separators.
- Added exact structural escaping (`\x20`, `\t`, `\r\n`, etc.) instead of collapsing invisible characters into ambiguous whitespace matches.
- Added recognition for non-breaking and other Unicode invisible spacing characters while preserving their exact UTF-8 form.
- Prevented learned prefix rules from crossing line or paragraph boundaries.
- Fixed punctuation-followed-by-newline inference so the newline is not incorrectly absorbed into the punctuation delimiter.
- Added standalone regression coverage for Windows/Linux line endings, tabs, repeated spaces, NBSP, Greek/Unicode text, and U+2028 line separators.

## Development Version 122 — Learned Regex Auto-Formatting (Milestone 1)

- Added **Learn formatting from text** to Auto Styling Rules.
- Infers reusable regex rules from manually formatted canonical rich-text runs.
- Supports delimiter-based paragraph prefixes such as speaker names before `:`, `|`, `-`, `)` or `]`.
- Added regex full-match/capture-group evaluation with fail-closed invalid-pattern handling.
- Learned rules preserve their inferred character-format mask without requiring a style preset.
- Persisted regex pattern, capture group and case-sensitivity in title JSON.
- Added Unicode/Greek regression coverage proving one formatted speaker prefix can style subsequent rows.

## Development Version 121 — Temporal Graph Editor and Manual Velocity Handles

- Added a dedicated Graph Editor mode to the timeline with switchable Value Graph and Speed Graph views, sub-frame curve sampling, final evaluator values, current-time indication, and correct layer-local-to-timeline time mapping.
- Added per-keyframe incoming/outgoing temporal influence and speed, linked/broken temporal tangent state, and Linear, Hold, Auto Bezier, Continuous Bezier, and Manual Bezier modes while preserving legacy segment easing until an explicit velocity edit is made.
- Added deterministic cubic temporal evaluation in real time/value space with Newton iteration plus bisection fallback. Time influences remain single-valued, while property values and speeds remain unclamped to support negative values and overshoot.
- Added direct incoming/outgoing velocity-handle dragging in Value and Speed graphs. Alt-drag breaks only the edited temporal pair; linked handles preserve paired speed/influence editing.
- Added Easy Ease, Easy Ease In, Easy Ease Out, and a numeric Keyframe Velocity dialog for mode, incoming/outgoing influence, and incoming/outgoing speed.
- Added marquee and Shift multi-keyframe selection, relative multi-edit for keyframe time/value and velocity deltas, graph zoom, pan, Fit Graphs, and Fit Selection in both axes.
- Added the temporal interpolation and velocity commands to the ordinary timeline keyframe context menu as well as the Graph Editor context menu.
- Routed scalar, vector Position, scalar-group, and numeric extension animation through the same temporal evaluator used by editor playback, OBS output, and prerender/cache rendering.
- Persisted temporal velocity metadata in title JSON, retained extension metadata during keyframe value updates, and included all temporal fields in cache fingerprints.
- Kept graph edits on the timeline's existing undo stack: drag operations commit once on release, while mode, Easy Ease, and numeric-dialog edits create immediate title snapshots.
- Preserved independently authored 0–100% incoming/outgoing influences without silent pair renormalization, keeping displayed graph handles identical to the temporal cubic used for final evaluation.
- Stabilized multi-keyframe crossing edits by preserving extension-track index identity during drag and remapping the selected keys only after the release-time sort. Legacy easing presets now explicitly exit velocity mode on native and extension tracks.
- Defined deterministic endpoint behavior even for sub-epsilon keyframe intervals and expanded finite-difference checks so the Speed Graph derivative agrees with the Value Graph curve.
- Expanded standalone animation tests and added a temporal Graph Editor source contract covering overshoot, negative values, very short intervals, UI interactions, persistence, cache invalidation, extension properties, and shared evaluation.

## Development Version 120 — On-Canvas Motion Paths

- Expanded the selected animated layer overlay into a directly editable final-space motion path with keyframe vertices, incoming/outgoing Bezier handles, current-position marker, and direction indication.
- Added direct vertex dragging and tangent dragging on the canvas. Vertex edits are inverse-mapped through the parent/group hierarchy into layer-local Position values; tangent edits remain layer-local and support Shift 45-degree constraints and Alt-drag break behavior for only the selected tangent pair.
- Added double-click path subdivision. Cubic segments use deterministic de Casteljau splitting so the inserted keyframe lies on the existing curve without moving the surrounding authored vertices.
- Added canvas and timeline context actions for Linear, Auto Bezier, Continuous Bezier, Manual Bezier, Rove Across Time, Break Tangents, and Join Tangents.
- Added deterministic roving-time redistribution for interior Position keyframes, persisted the rove flag in title JSON, retained it through keyframe copy/paste, and included it in cache fingerprints.
- Added motion-vertex snapping to user guides and other keyframe positions while excluding descendants when editing their parent/group, avoiding self-hierarchy snap feedback.
- Hid editable vertices/handles during inline text editing and on locked layers, while retaining a lightweight read-only path/current-position display.
- Kept hover highlighting overlay-only: handle/path hover invalidates the selection overlay rather than dirtying the title model or requesting a full rendered canvas frame.
- Added release-time undo snapshots for vertex/tangent drags and immediate snapshots for path insertion, interpolation mode, rove, and tangent break/join actions.
- Expanded animation and source-contract regression coverage for curve subdivision, stable keyframe vertices during mode changes, roving timing, transformed-space editing, snapping exclusions, and input wiring.

## Development Version 119 — Spatial Bezier Keyframes Core

- Separated temporal easing from spatial path interpolation for animated vector properties while retaining the existing temporal keyframe controls.
- Added layer-local incoming and outgoing spatial tangents, linked/broken state, and Linear, Auto Bezier, Continuous Bezier, and Manual Bezier modes to position keyframes.
- Added deterministic cubic Bezier evaluation in `AnimatedVec2Property`, shared automatically by the editor, prerender/cache pipeline, and OBS source output.
- Preserved backward compatibility: vector keyframes without spatial metadata deserialize as Linear and reproduce their previous straight-line motion exactly.
- Added canvas motion-path rendering and draggable incoming/outgoing handles. Shift constrains handle direction; Alt breaks a linked pair; linked handles preserve independent lengths.
- Added Position keyframe context-menu controls for spatial mode and Break/Join Tangents. Mode changes and tangent drags enter the existing undo/redo history.
- Persisted spatial tangents/mode/link state in title JSON and retained them through full-struct keyframe copy/paste.
- Kept tangent storage in layer-local coordinates and maps editing/display through parent/group transforms, preserving the authored curve under affine hierarchy transforms and nested composition placement.
- Added spatial metadata to cache fingerprints and cubic control hulls to dirty-region bounds so tangent edits invalidate prerenders and curved motion cannot be clipped by stale straight-line tile envelopes.
- Expanded standalone animation tests and added a source contract audit covering persistence, canvas editing, copy/paste, undo integration, cache invalidation, and shared evaluation.

## Development Version 118 — External Data Diagnostics Logging

- Added a dedicated **External Data** logging category covering provider lifecycle, asynchronous refreshes, parsing/publication, source states, field/table updates, table-to-cue synchronization, cue-cell resolution, and render-queue coalescing.
- Added Info, Debug, and Trace detail levels so normal sessions remain readable while diagnostics can follow individual source, field, row, layer, and cue paths.
- Added safe logging helpers that redact URL credentials/query strings and report value type, length, emptiness, and a deterministic fingerprint instead of raw external values or authentication tokens.
- Added UI action logs for source creation/removal/duplication, test/connect/disconnect/refresh, binding changes, mapping changes, and the actual Live Text Cue widget population path.
- Added a standard-library-only logging bridge so the external-data core remains testable without Qt/OBS, plus regression coverage for filtering, sanitization, redaction, fingerprints, and sink failures.
- Fixed table-managed Live Text Cue row changes in **Loop** and **Pause** modes: the OBS source now resolves the pending row through the same external binding/formatter path as immediate Play Once cues instead of applying the intentionally empty authored cell.
- Added cue-control diagnostics for requested/current/pending row, playback mode, transition phase, and the final source-side row commit, without logging raw cue values.

## Development Version 117 — Live Table Binding Preservation Fix

- Fixed mapped Live Text Cue rows being created with the correct count but blank values.
- `normalize_live_text_rows()` now validates generated cell bindings against the title's active column order instead of a moved-from temporary vector.
- Preserves `ExternalTableManaged` state, formatted live values, read-only behavior, and OBS/source runtime bindings when the cue table rebuilds.
- Added a runtime regression that reproduces the exact synchronize → normalize → dock display sequence.

## Development Version 116 — Live Table Value Resolution and Managed Cell State

- Fixed mapped Live Text Cue rows appearing blank while the table result preview contained values.
- Row-specific table runtime values now take precedence over same-path scalar fields or schema placeholders.
- Added an explicit `ExternalTableManaged` cue-cell state: mapped text/image cells are read-only and italic in the dock while remaining cueable.
- Added **Convert to editable value** and **Restore table-managed value** actions. Detached snapshots survive provider refreshes without changing the table mapping for other cells.
- Preserved the exact mapped cell value across transient provider-registry rebuilds.
- Added regression coverage for scalar shadowing, read-only state, detachment, authored-value preservation, and restoration.

## Development Version 115 — Live Table Value Resolution and Cue Styling

- Fixed table-managed Live Text Cue rows remaining blank when a provider exposed valid table cells but did not publish an identical row-specific scalar field key.
- Added a runtime-only authoritative value to generated table cell bindings; it is rebuilt from each table snapshot and is never serialized over authored cue data.
- Routed the runtime value through the same `ExternalDataManager::resolve()` pipeline, preserving connection state, keep-last-value, formatter, empty-value, fallback, and field-default behavior.
- Ensured `apply_live_text_runtime_binding()` carries the table value into editor playback and the OBS source path, not only the dock preview.
- Included runtime table values in unchanged-update comparison so a value-only table refresh updates cue widgets/output without rebuilding unrelated rows.
- Displayed table-managed values in italics inside the Live Text Cues table as a visual origin indicator; output typography remains unchanged.
- Added regression coverage for table snapshots with no scalar row paths and for value-only table updates.

## Development Version 114 — Live Table Cue Value Display Fix

- Fixed source-managed Live Text Cue rows appearing blank even though their generated external bindings were valid.
- Bound text and image cue cells now display the resolved, formatted live provider value in the dock.
- Preserved the authored/fallback cell value separately, so live display refreshes never overwrite authored cue data.
- Added a regression contract requiring table-mapped cells to resolve through `effective_live_text_cue_value()` when their widgets are created.

## Development Version 113 — External Table to Live Cue Mapping

- Added automatic table snapshots for JSON arrays, nested JSON arrays, CSV data rows, local text, and manual/internal providers.
- Added **Populate from external table…** to the Live Text Cues data menu with source/table selection and live result preview.
- Added per-column mapping from provider table fields to exposed cue columns, using the same formatter, fallback, and live-value pipeline as ordinary external bindings.
- Added Replace, Append, and Synchronize update modes, optional starting row/row limit, empty-row filtering, and preservation of manual cue rows.
- Added stable row identity from a selected field or provider row index so synchronized updates retain the correct cue row when source ordering changes.
- Generated cells remain real external-data bindings, retain last-known/fallback behavior, update without authored-value mutation or undo commands, and display the existing bound-cell indicators.
- Added asynchronous provider refresh integration, table-update coalescing, unchanged-snapshot suppression, source-managed row cleanup, and current/pending cue remapping by stable row ID.
- Added runtime and structural regression coverage for table discovery, mapping, shared formatting, row synchronization, cleanup, and UI integration.

## Development Version 112 — Automatic External Field Discovery

- External JSON file, HTTP JSON, WebSocket, and CSV providers now discover every scalar field on each successful update even when schema overrides already exist.
- Discovered nested JSON paths, array indexes, CSV headers, and numeric CSV columns appear immediately in binding popups and existing settings rows without reopening the dialog.
- Reworked **Fields** into an optional schema override table with explicit pinning, display-name/type customization, manual values, and live values.
- Binding a discovered field from a layer property, provider binding row, or live cue cell automatically pins its inferred schema so it remains available while offline.
- Authored/pinned field types remain stable, while unpinned discovered fields may follow genuine provider type changes until they are pinned.
- Unchecking/removing a schema override now releases its fixed type/alias on the next provider synchronization without discarding the last discovered value.
- Added runtime and structural coverage for discovery, auto-pinning, offline placeholders, JSON/CSV discovery with overrides, and unchanged authored-value behavior.

## Development Version 111 — External Data UI and Formatting

- Completed External Data Source Settings with a state-aware source list, add/remove/duplicate actions, provider-specific connection settings, test connection, manual refresh, live field values, timestamps, errors, and refresh status.
- Added serialized refresh behavior per source: refresh on cue, refresh continuously, or refresh manually.
- Added a reusable external-data binding popup for text and image properties with source, field, typed fallback, live raw/formatted preview, and provider state.
- Added a shared structured formatter pipeline for prefix/suffix, decimal places, thousands separators, text case, date/time formatting, conditional replacement, and empty-value behavior while retaining legacy formatter compatibility.
- Added external-data bindings to live text/image cue cells, including refresh-on-cue behavior and runtime-only overrides that preserve authored cue and layer values.
- Added visible bound-state indicators on property buttons, cue cells, and layer rows.
- Added backward-compatible serialization for formatter configurations, refresh modes, and stable cue-cell bindings.
- Added runtime coverage for formatting, cue bindings, authored-value preservation, and a Development Version 111 UI contract test.

## Development Version 110 — Isolated Qt WebSockets Bootstrap

- Downloads the official `qt/qtwebsockets` module automatically when it is absent from the OBS Qt6 dependency bundle.
- Pins the downloaded source to the exact detected Qt patch version (`v<Qt6_VERSION>`) to prevent ABI mismatches.
- Configures, builds, and installs the module through a separate `ExternalProject` CMake process.
- Prevents the module's internal `find_package(Qt6)` from colliding with vcpkg/OBS imported targets such as `Threads::Threads`.
- Disables examples, tests, benchmarks, manual tests, and standalone tests so Qt Quick is not required.
- Exposes the installed static library to the plugin through an imported `Qt6::WebSockets` target.
- Reuses the versioned `_deps/qtwebsockets-<Qt version>` source, build, and install cache.

# Changelog

## Development Version 108

- Fixed Windows OBS dependency discovery so Qt6 is resolved from `lib/cmake/Qt6` and other supported SDK layouts.
- Prevented a detected Qt6 OBS SDK from silently falling back to Qt5.
- Split Qt WebSockets discovery from the base Qt modules to produce an accurate missing-component diagnostic.


## Development Version 108 — Asynchronous External Data Providers

- Added a common `IExternalDataProvider` lifecycle with connect, disconnect, refresh, validation, state, and error reporting.
- Added providers for JSON files, CSV files, HTTP/HTTPS JSON endpoints, WebSocket feeds, local text files, and manual/internal data tables.
- Moved every provider, polling timer, file read, HTTP request, and WebSocket connection to a dedicated worker thread so the UI and OBS render thread remain non-blocking.
- Added nested JSON field paths and array indexing, JSON root selection, CSV row selection, first-row headers, and field-to-column mapping.
- Added HTTP headers, bearer-token authentication, configurable timeout, retry count, exponential retry backoff, and refresh intervals.
- Added WebSocket JSON message parsing, automatic exponential reconnect, explicit connect/disconnect/refresh controls, and configurable last-known-value behavior.
- Added provider-side rate limiting and latest-value coalescing before the existing manager/render queue, while unchanged values remain suppressed by `ExternalDataManager`.
- Added `Connected`, `Updating`, `Disconnected`, `Error`, and `Stale` runtime states without waking rendering when an informative state transition cannot change the effective value.
- Added a provider settings dialog with source configuration, field definitions, manual values, CSV mappings, request options, live state/error/last-update reporting, and direct provider-field bindings to text/image layer properties.
- Persisted provider configuration with titles while keeping current values, runtime errors, and connection state transient and backward compatible.
- Added shutdown synchronization, last-known-value behavioral coverage, and a Development 107 provider contract audit.

## Development Version 106 — Provider-neutral External Data Core

- Added the central, thread-safe `ExternalDataManager` with provider-neutral source schemas, typed fields, current values, source/field timestamps, and connection/error state.
- Added external field types for string, integer, float, boolean, color, date/time, image/file paths, and URLs.
- Added optional per-layer property bindings with source ID, field path, formatter, and binding fallback while preserving the ordinary authored property as the final fallback.
- Persisted external source definitions and layer bindings in title/project JSON without persisting runtime current values or connection state, preserving compatibility with titles that have no external-data keys.
- Wired `text.content` and `image.path` through transient effective-value resolution in the editor, OBS source renderer, scene-mask paths, compatibility/GPU image paths, and cache identity.
- Added a provider-free mock update API, editor refresh callbacks, and a coalescing thread-safe update queue consumed on the OBS render/tick path.
- Suppressed notifications, render work, runtime revision changes, and cache invalidation when a provider repeats an unchanged value.
- Added behavioral and source-contract tests for authored/live/fallback resolution, connection loss, typed updates, mock fields, serialization, and render-queue coalescing.

## Development Version 105 — OmniaTV branding, v0.8.7-alpha, application icon, and documentation consolidation

- Updated the public version to `v0.8.7-alpha` and Development Version 105 across CMake, runtime build metadata, packaging, and dependency manifests.
- Replaced the previous personal credit with **Developed by: omniatv**.
- Added theme-aware normal/inverted OmniaTV logos to the About dialog and linked the logo to `https://omniatv.com`.
- Added the Broadcast Graphics Live application icon and applied it to editor windows and plugin-owned dialogs that previously inherited the OBS application icon.
- Rebuilt the README as a concise project overview and removed stale, duplicated, and personal branding references.
- Consolidated the large collection of one-off documentation notes into seven canonical thematic documents plus this index/changelog set.
- Expanded `.gitignore` for CMake/build outputs, IDE files, generated packages, platform artifacts, caches, logs, temporary files, and local configuration overrides.
- Folded the obsolete standalone PowerShell manifest-fix notes into the maintained build documentation and removed the redundant root text files.

## Development Version 104 — Effects Panel Spacing, Bottom Toolbar and Dock Names

- Removed the extra gap between every effect header and its first setting while preserving the shared side and bottom panel insets.
- Moved the Effects toolbar below the scrollable effect stack, keeping **Add Effect** and **Respect Masks** permanently accessible at the bottom of the dock.
- Renamed the effect-stack dock to **Effects Settings** and the presets dock to **Effects and Presets**, including their Window-menu actions.

## Development Version 103 — Qt6 Title Thumbnail Repaint Compile Fix

- Removed the per-item `QListWidget::visualItemRect()` repaint path from title cue-state refreshes, eliminating the reported MSVC/Qt6 member-resolution compile failure.
- Title thumbnail cue-state changes are now accumulated and trigger one safe viewport repaint after all item roles are updated.
- Preserved immediate cue/uncue thumbnail feedback while reducing redundant paint requests for title lists with multiple items.

## Development Version 102 — Panel-based Effects Stack and Persistent Inspectors

- Replaced the separate Effects Stack list and single Effect Settings editor with one panel-based stack: every effect is shown as its own collapsible settings panel and the visible panel order is the actual render-stack order.
- Reduced the Effects toolbar to **Add Effect** and **Respect Masks**, removing the old Remove, Duplicate, Move Up, and Move Down buttons.
- Added an enable switch directly in every effect header, between the drag handle and effect name, and removed the duplicate Enabled control from the settings body.
- Added a compact overflow menu immediately before the caret with **Duplicate Effect**, **Delete Effect**, **Move Up**, and **Move Down** actions.
- Connected effect-panel drag-and-drop reordering directly to the layer effect model while preserving the selected effect, keyframe bindings, canvas handles, and effect-specific controls.
- Persisted collapsible-panel expanded state and user-defined panel order across editor sessions through `QSettings`; effect order continues to persist in the title/layer model rather than editor preferences.
- Replaced the layer-list expand/collapse icons with the same native caret renderer used by the inspector panels, including the three-state group expansion marker.
- Updated the effects interaction regression contract for the new list-free panel stack and persistent shared panel/caret infrastructure.

## Development Version 101 — Unified Collapsible and Reorderable Inspector Panels

- Made the compact switch track and thumb smaller, lower-contrast, and less visually dominant while retaining clear checked, mixed, hover, focus, and disabled states.
- Added the reusable `BglCollapsiblePanel` widget with a compact After Effects-style header, a drag handle at the left, and an expand/collapse caret at the right.
- Added true sibling-panel reordering by drag-and-drop from the header handle, including before/after drop indicators and preservation of layout stretch factors.
- Unified panel chrome, spacing, body shading, borders, accent separators, and content margins between the Properties and Effects inspectors.
- Migrated the Properties inspector sections, Shape/Image custom sections, gradient Presets/Stops, Effects Stack, Effect Settings, selected effect controls, and nested effect element controls to the common panel widget.
- Preserved dynamic section visibility, existing controls/signals, keyframe behavior, explicit custom colors, and active OBS palette inheritance without adding a third-party runtime dependency.

## Development Version 100 — Compact After Effects-style Qt Controls

- Added native compact Qt widgets that follow the active OBS palette instead of installing an application-wide theme or overriding explicitly customized colors.
- Replaced editor, Effects, Preferences, Transitions, Dock-dialog, and Prerender checkboxes with sleek switch controls.
- Added circular direction controls with synchronized numeric input for Drop Shadow, Inner Shadow, and Long Shadow angles.
- Added strong theme-accented section dividers throughout the layer Properties panel and tightened panel spacing for a denser After Effects-like workflow.
- Added a reusable internal widget layer for future compact controls without adding a third-party runtime dependency.
- Reviewed MIT-licensed Qlementine and LGPL-2.1 Qt Advanced Stylesheets; neither is bundled because both are designed to own the application-level style and could interfere with OBS theme inheritance.

## Development Version 099 — Qt6 Thumbnail Repaint Compile Fix

- Fixed the Titles & Graphics cue-state repaint call for Qt6/MSVC.
- `visualItemRect()` is now invoked on the owning `QListWidget`, rather than incorrectly on `QListWidgetItem`.
- Preserves the lightweight immediate thumbnail-state repaint without triggering preview or cache regeneration.

## Development Version 098 — Thumbnail Ending-State Cleanup

- Synchronized the **Titles and Graphics** thumbnails with the live cue runtime state.
- Active cues use the same red border as the active Live Text Cue row.
- Cue-to-cue transitions and manual uncue/outro playback switch the thumbnail border to yellow until the outgoing title reaches its authored end.
- Cues waiting to become active use a green border, while inactive titles have no cue-state border.
- Applied the state consistently in both list view and icon view, including titles without exposed Live Text fields.

## Development Version 096 — Live Cue Header Runtime Timer

- Added a live runtime counter at the right side of the **Live Text Cues** header.
- Pause and Loop cues show elapsed on-air time as `MM:SS`.
- Cue-to-cue transitions and full uncue outros show the exact remaining time as `MM:SS:T` (minutes omitted below one minute).
- Play Once cues show the remaining time from their appearance until the authored title end.
- The counter is driven by the active OBS source playhead and disappears when no selected title source is running.

## Development Version 095 — Yellow Uncue/Outro Cue State

- Added a dedicated yellow `ending` visual state for the active Live Text Cue row while its uncue/outro is playing.
- The Cue button/icon, cue-row background, and cue-row border switch from red to yellow immediately when uncue begins.
- The yellow state remains active through Play Once, Pause, Loop, and Ping-Pong Loop outro playback and clears only when the authored end is reached and `When cue ends` is applied.
- Kept queued cues green and normally active cues red, with the ending state taking visual priority over the active state.
- Added a regression contract covering the yellow state source, priority, dock refresh paths, static title-only cue rows, and row decoration.

## Development Version 094 — Continuous Uncue Playback and Live Cue Text Snapshots

- Changed manual uncue so Play Once, Pause, Loop, and Ping-Pong Loop titles continue forward from the exact current on-air frame instead of seeking to the pause/loop boundary.
- Kept the cue active throughout the outro and applied the configured `When cue ends` behavior only after the title reaches its authored end.
- Fixed title-only cue toggles for titles without exposed live-text fields by preserving their synthetic cue row until the outro completes.
- Made the active cue's already-applied text/image values authoritative for cached playback, so editing a live-text cue row does not alter the current cue or its uncue; the edited values appear on the next cue.
- Kept cue-to-cue Pause/Loop transitions using their authored hand-off points while limiting current-frame continuation specifically to manual uncue.
- Added a dedicated uncue/playback-text-snapshot regression contract covering dock actions, title hotkeys, source state transitions, cache lookup, and end behavior.

## Development Version 093 — Layer-Space Effects Stack and Background Bounds Fix

- Kept ordinary layer effects on the transform-neutral padded layer raster instead of rerouting the complete stack to a full-canvas pass when Shadow, Glow, Outline, Blur, Bloom, or Long Shadow is present.
- Fixed initial Background Color bounds by versioning the base raster retention mode and translating layer-box/clip metadata whenever an alpha-only raster is cropped.
- Made Background Color geometry explicitly layer-relative, preventing a later Shadow/Glow pass from expanding the fill across the complete canvas.
- Added an affine layer-space basis for full-canvas group, matte, and adjustment paths, so spatial effects follow layer translation, scaling, rotation, and parent transforms.
- Anchored 4-Color Gradient, Lens Flare, Vignette, Noise, and Roughen Edges to layer space while keeping texture sampling in surface space.
- Added missing local support padding for Lens Flare and Roughen Edges, excluded affect-behind effects from unnecessary local-raster expansion, and versioned GPU/disk cache identities.
- Added a dedicated effects-stack layer-space/bounds regression contract and reran the existing effect, procedural shader, cache, modularity, and MSVC include-order audits.

## Development Version 092 — MSVC GPU Cache Alias Compile Fix

- Fixed the MSVC `C2267`/`C2601` failure caused by defining `alias_global_gpu_frame_locked()` between implementation fragments that form one contiguous function body.
- Kept the GPU cache alias helper visible through a top-level forward declaration and moved its definition after all split `title-source` function continuations are closed.
- Added a structural regression audit that verifies the include order, top-level declaration, and balanced combined translation unit.

## Development Version 091 — Linux Text Visibility, Typing Refresh, and Temporal Cache Reuse

- Preserved Linux/FreeType `QImage::Format_Alpha8` glyph coverage explicitly before SDF generation, preventing valid glyph masks from becoming blank during GPU text rendering.
- Replaced partial dynamic-atlas writes with complete uploads of smaller 1024×1024 R8 pages, preventing discard-mapped atlas contents from producing random glyph fragments while typing.
- Made text edits cancel delayed presentation work and force an immediate full-canvas GPU present, so typed characters and text-box geometry appear without waiting for a coalesced playback/editor tick.
- Connected exact evaluated visual-state deduplication to the prerender worker. The first frame of an unchanged state is canonical; subsequent frames share its GPU tiles and create metadata-only SSD aliases instead of repeating layout, effects, compositing, readback, and compression.
- Resolved an equivalent canonical frame already waiting for GPU readback before submitting another one, eliminating redundant in-flight renders.
- Restricted temporal reuse to fully deterministic/cacheable titles and excluded animated asset timelines whose local playback mapping can differ from root timeline time.
- Bumped the cache ABI to invalidate older blank/corrupted Linux text payloads and added a dedicated Development Version 091 structural regression audit.

## Development Version 090 — Text Position-Map Compile Fix

- Fixed the Windows/MSVC build regression introduced by the Development Version 089 UTF-8/UTF-16 position-map optimization.
- Updated the remaining rich-text range call to pass the shared `EditorQtUtf8PositionMap` required by the new helper signature.
- Replaced stale editor-side `rich_byte_offset_from_qtext_position()` calls with the local position map already built for the `QTextDocument` conversion.
- Replaced stale source compatibility-renderer `qtext_position_from_rich_byte_offset_source()` calls with the local `SourceQtUtf8PositionMap`, resolving the cascading `std::min`/`std::max` template errors.
- Added regression-contract coverage that rejects the removed conversion helpers and verifies that editor and source compatibility paths reuse their local maps.

## Development Version 089 — Linux Text Rendering and Text Pipeline Performance Audit

- Retained the exact physical `QRawFont` selected by Qt shaping and Fontconfig and reused that face in the GPU glyph atlas. Linux fallback glyphs are no longer reconstructed only from family/style names, and visible glyphs that cannot produce an alpha map fall back to the Qt compatibility renderer instead of disappearing.
- Reworked inline typing around canonical UTF-8 range edits. Ordinary insertion, Backspace, Enter, and single-character replacement no longer rebuild the complete `QTextDocument`, synchronously render a frame, or repeat document-size and cursor conversions for the same keystroke.
- Coalesced Properties panel, Timeline model, live-output publication, and canvas invalidation during continuous typing while preserving immediate editor feedback and the normal full commit path at the end of editing.
- Added per-paragraph UTF-8/UTF-16 position maps across shaping, source compatibility rendering, and editor adapters, removing repeated string slicing/conversion work for Unicode, emoji, RTL, and large rich-text documents.
- Changed the glyph atlas to upload only newly dirtied rectangles instead of retransferring an entire 2048×2048 page for each uncached glyph, and reduced transient layout allocations through reserved/merged GPU batches and binary paint-run lookup.
- Removed repeated full `Layer` copies and redundant rich-text normalization passes from layout/evaluation hot paths. Auto-style state is now indexed by Unicode code-point boundaries, and transient editor drafts bypass the shared process cache while the retained cache is byte-bounded.
- Audited text property propagation from model through Qt layout and GPU paint runs. Fixed mixed-range underline/strikethrough handling, connected stroke antialiasing to the shader, preserved every fill/gradient/stroke field, and route unsupported miter/bevel inline joins through the exact compatibility raster path.
- Added standalone Unicode/model/layout tests and a text-pipeline performance contract covering Linux font identity, glyph upload behavior, canonical range editing, coalesced editor refreshes, property propagation, and removal of known quadratic conversion paths.

## Development Version 088 — Independent Monitor-Rate Editor Presentation

- Replaced the editor canvas `obs_display_t` presentation path with an editor-owned libobs GPU swap chain. OBS displays are rendered from the main project video loop, so timer-only throttling could not make a stopped editor present faster than the project frame rate.
- Editing, direct manipulation, text editing, keyframe changes, and timeline scrubbing now present from the Qt monitor-paced path and are capped by the refresh rate of the monitor hosting the editor.
- Real transport playback remains isolated: only project-rate transport ticks authorize a canvas present while playback is active. Generic Qt repaints cannot add extra playback frames.
- Retained the existing GPU artwork renderer, overlays, selection inversion, color-space updates, resize handling, and explicit shutdown teardown while changing only swap-chain ownership and presentation scheduling.
- Counted any graphics-backend present wait inside the monitor cadence and coalesced pending presents, preventing double waits and runaway repaint queues on high-refresh displays.
- Added regression coverage that rejects reintroduction of `obs_display_create()` for the editor canvas and verifies independent swap-chain creation, monitor-paced editing, project-paced playback, and shutdown destruction.

## Development Version 087 — Monitor-Capped Editing and Project-Rate Playback

- Canvas artwork refreshes while editing are capped to, and never scheduled above, the refresh rate of the monitor currently hosting the editor window.
- Timeline scrubbing is always treated as editing and never bypasses the monitor cap, even if transport state changes during the interaction.
- Playback refresh is driven only by the project/OBS frame rate, independent of monitor refresh rate.
- Removed the previous hidden 60 Hz transport ceiling, allowing 100/120/144 fps projects to preview at their configured project cadence when rendering can keep up.
- Render-cost pacing remains active, so expensive frames may run below the monitor cap without creating an event backlog.
- Moving the editor between monitors recalculates the editing cadence safely after the window/layout transition.

## Development Version 086 — Shutdown Safety and Effect-Handle Performance Audit

- Added an explicit, idempotent editor shutdown phase that stops all editor/dock timers, disconnects cross-widget Effects Stack ↔ Canvas callbacks, and prevents late playhead, autosave, paint, or property updates from running during Qt child destruction.
- Added explicit Canvas GPU teardown before widget destruction, including OBS display callbacks/textures and the editor GPU render session, with shutdown guards on queued title/playhead updates and draw callbacks.
- Deduplicated effect canvas-handle publication and Canvas ingestion, avoiding repeated JSON rebuild-driven repaints and GPU invalidations when evaluated handle positions have not changed.
- Kept both possible Effects Stack/Canvas construction orders safe with unique signal connections, preventing duplicate handle updates.
- Moved dock removal and frontend callback cleanup into the OBS-supported shutdown window and prevented frontend API calls after `OBS_FRONTEND_EVENT_EXIT`.
- Added deterministic shutdown of the asynchronous title-store save worker before the final synchronous save, preventing stale writes and plugin code execution during module unload.
- Added regression coverage for shutdown guards, timer/signal teardown, GPU resource release, frontend lifecycle rules, save-worker joining, and handle-update deduplication.

## Development Version 085 — Stable Effect Handle Dragging and Keyframed Positions

- Preserved the active effect canvas handle across live Effects Stack refreshes, preventing a point drag from falling through to the layer resize/scale interaction after the first mouse movement.
- Re-evaluated and republished effect canvas-handle positions whenever the playhead changes, so native and extension point controls follow their keyframes in real time.
- Restored the original unrestricted radial Fill Gradient center and radius editing. Only the focal point remains constrained just inside the active radial circle, while a non-zero radius prevents inverted or malformed gradients.
- Added regression coverage for active-handle identity during drag, playhead-driven handle refresh, unrestricted center/radius motion, and focal-circle safety.

## Development Version 084 — Effect Handle Wiring, Vector Editing and Stable Stack Selection

- Connected the Effects Stack dock to the already-created canvas in the editor's real construction order, restoring visible and draggable on-canvas controls for native and extension effect positioning properties.
- Added independent draggable **X** and **Y** labels to extension point/vector controls, so both components support the same drag-to-edit workflow and undo grouping.
- Prevented transient `currentRowChanged(-1)` notifications during Effects Stack rebuilding from replacing the selected effect with the first stack item after an edit.
- Constrained radial Fill Gradient controllers: the center stays inside the fill bounds, the radius handle cannot move beyond the bounds in its active direction, and the focal handle remains inside the radial circle to avoid malformed or inverted rendering.
- Added regression coverage for late canvas/dock signal wiring, vector-axis drag labels, stable effect selection, and radial handle constraints.

## Development Version 083 — Unified Effect Keyframes and Canvas Position Handles

- Unified built-in and extension effect diamonds with the editor's standard keyframe behavior: inactive/animated/active states, click-to-toggle at the playhead, automatic insertion while editing an animated property, right-click **Delete All Keyframes**, and timeline easing/interpolation support.
- Added native and extension effect-property tracks to the layer timeline with unique per-effect-instance identities, including copy, cut, paste, multi-selection, drag retiming, easing changes, and keyframe deletion.
- Grouped native effect color channels into a single timeline color track, so moving, copying, deleting, or changing easing updates Alpha, Red, Green, and Blue keyframes together.
- Added a confirmation modal when removing an effect that contains native or extension keyframes. Confirming removes the effect and all of its associated timeline tracks; cancelling preserves both.
- Added transform-aware on-canvas handles for every extension point/position parameter and for native Lens Flare/Vignette centers plus Background Color gradient center and focal point. Handles follow layer rotation, scale, parenting, and group transforms and respect auto-key animation.
- Applied extension keyframe easing consistently in both the GPU presentation path and compatibility compositor, including Linear, Ease In, Ease Out, Easy Ease, custom Bezier, and Hold interpolation.
- Added regression coverage for effect-instance timeline tracks, grouped color animation, deletion warnings, extension clipboard operations, easing, and layer-local canvas-handle conversion.

## Development Version 082 — Content-Clipped 4-Color Gradient and Visible Effect Keyframes

- Changed **4-Color Gradient** to use the original layer artwork alpha as its matte, so the generated colors are clipped to text glyphs, transparent images, shapes, and composited group content instead of filling the layer bounding rectangle.
- Fixed effect keyframe controls that were backed by animation data but rendered as font-dependent Unicode glyphs; they now use the same reliable SVG diamond icons as the main Properties panel.
- Replaced font-dependent Unicode diamond characters with the editor's actual active/inactive keyframe SVG icons across built-in, extension, color, point, enum, boolean, and compound-element effect properties.
- Preserved direct keyframe toggling, playhead-state updates, animated-value editing, accessibility labels, and extension keyframe persistence.

## Development Version 081 — Effects Cleanup, Keyframes and 4-Color Gradient

- Removed obsolete effect controls that were still visible although the GPU renderer ignored them, including legacy blur-type selectors, nonfunctional blend-mode selectors, and unsupported outline/background corner variants. Backward-compatible serialized fields remain readable but are no longer exposed as misleading controls.
- Added diamond keyframe controls beside every effect option backed by an animation property, including the new generated-gradient points, colors, Blend, Jitter, and Opacity controls.
- Repaired **Background Color** so it uses the layer raster bounds and animated padding/corner/gradient values while always compositing the original layer artwork above the generated background.
- Rebuilt **Emboss** as a directional relief effect driven by alpha and luminance, with functional Depth, Height, Angle, Softness, and Opacity controls.
- Added **Built-in → Generate → 4-Color Gradient** with four movable points, four independently keyframeable colors, Blend, Jitter, Opacity, blending modes, and on-canvas point handles.
- Added regression coverage for the effect registry, extension schema, cleaned UI contract, shader uniforms, Background Color compositing, Emboss relief, and 4-Color Gradient animation bindings.

## Development Version 080 — Restored Consistent Canvas Scaling

- Restored the unified pre-074 scaling contract for every canvas object after it regressed in Development Version 079.
- Normal, Shift-constrained, snapped, rotated, and Alt centre-resize now all derive from the same pointer-defined local target rectangle.
- Scale-backed Text, Group, and Asset Layers receive the required position correction on every resize, not only while Alt is held, so the grabbed handle stays under the pointer and the opposite handle remains fixed.
- Size-backed shapes, images, and other layers preserve the animated origin as a fraction of the new dimensions instead of reusing stale absolute local offsets.
- Removed the competing second Alt-only position correction that could pull the object away from both the pointer and its intended anchor.
- Added a regression contract that rejects both the absolute-offset path and modifier-specific anchor correction while preserving the fixed animated Asset Layer envelope introduced in Version 079.

## Development Version 079 — Static Animated Asset Bounds and Direct Asset Editing

- Animated Asset Layers now calculate a fixed envelope from the union of the source composition across its complete animation, including keyframed transforms, animated size/origin/free-transform corners, nested asset content, timed visibility, and general slide/scale transitions. The selection box no longer changes with the playhead; the animation runs inside one stable bounding box spanning its spatial extremes.
- The Assets library context menu now includes **Edit Asset** alongside Insert and Delete.
- Right-clicking a single Asset Layer on the canvas now exposes **Edit Asset** for its linked source asset.
- When the current title has unsaved changes, Edit Asset opens a modal with **Save**, **Discard**, and **Cancel** before switching the editor to the source asset. Saving the asset preserves its asset identity, so it remains hidden from Titles & Graphics and available in Libraries → Assets.

## Development Version 078 — Independent Asset Playback Controls

- Asset Layers now expose synchronized/independent playback only when their nested composition contains real timeline animation: keyframes, transitions, timed visibility, animated effects, or another animated Asset Layer.
- Independent Asset Layers use a per-instance monotonic runtime clock in both the editor and OBS output, so scrubbing or stopping the parent title playhead no longer changes their animation time.
- Assets saved with Pause playback expose **Pause for** with an `HH:MM:SS:FF` timecode plus a complete-animation Loop toggle.
- Assets saved with Loop playback expose **Loop _N_ times** plus a complete-animation Loop toggle; restart and ping-pong loop areas are both preserved.
- Source duration, pause marker, loop area, loop type, playback mode, pause duration, and loop count are stored in each Asset Layer snapshot for reliable offline/nested playback.
- Static assets no longer show the synchronized/independent selector or any playback-only controls.

## Development Version 076 — Unified Libraries Dock

The former Styles dock is now named **Libraries** and contains a single ordered tab set: **Color Swatches**, **Gradients**, **Text Styles**, and **Assets**. Color Swatches has been moved into this tab set and its standalone dock/window action has been removed. The separate Animated Assets library has also been removed; the unified Assets tab now lists both static and animated asset titles while preserving each asset layer’s synchronized or independent playback behavior. Saved editor layouts are migrated to the new dock schema.

## Development Version 075 — Assets and Animated Assets

Complete titles can now be saved from **File → Save as Asset** and reused inside other titles as dedicated **Asset Layers**. The Styles dock includes searchable, categorized **Assets** and **Animated Assets** libraries with double-click insertion and drag-and-drop directly onto the canvas. Asset instances preserve exposed text/image overrides, effects, mattes, nested composition, group-style content bounds, and either synchronized title-time playback or independent ticker-style animation. Asset records are intentionally hidden from the Titles & Graphics dock and OBS title-source selector.

> **Alpha software:** This build is intended for development and testing. Keep backups of important projects and templates. File formats, UI behavior, performance characteristics, and internal APIs may still change before the stable release.

## Development Version 074 — Consistent Group Canvas Manipulation

- Group transform handles and transform calculations now use the same descendant-derived local bounds.
- Move, resize, rotate, snapping, Shift-constrained resize, and Alt centre-resize no longer operate from a synthetic centred rectangle.
- Asymmetric and nested groups manipulate from the exact canvas outline shown to the user.
- Group duplication drag keeps the copied hierarchy as the active gesture target.
- Development Version 074 is exposed through the editor title, dock/About UI, build metadata, and plugin log.

## Development Version 073 — Authoritative Duplicate Drag Target

- Alt+drag now keeps the duplicated layer IDs as the authoritative gesture target for every mouse-move event until release.
- Synchronous layer-list or timeline selection refreshes can no longer redirect the drag back to the original artwork.
- The duplicated layers remain selected when the drag completes.
- Development Version 073 is exposed through the editor title, dock/About UI, build metadata, and plugin log.

## Development Version 072 — Continuous Alt+Drag Duplication

- Alt+drag now transfers the active canvas gesture directly to the duplicated layer IDs.
- The duplicate continues following the pointer immediately after it is created; the original remains at its starting position.
- The behavior is shared by single layers, multi-selection, groups, and nested groups.
- Synchronous layer-list and timeline refreshes can no longer redirect the in-progress drag back to the original selection.
- Development Version 072 is exposed through the editor title, dock/About UI, build metadata, and plugin log.

## Development Version 071 — Group Alt+Drag Duplication

- Alt+drag on the canvas now duplicates complete group layers, including all nested child layers and nested groups.
- Internal group membership, parenting, transform-parent, and matte references are remapped to the duplicated hierarchy.
- Only the duplicated root selection is moved during the drag, preventing child transforms from being applied twice.
- Locked children inside an unlocked duplicated group are preserved as part of the copied container.
- Development Version 071 is exposed through the editor title, dock/About UI, build metadata, and plugin log.

## Development Version 070 — Clipping Matte Shape Coverage Fix

- Changed **Clipping Matte** extraction to use the matte source artwork shape at full compositor opacity instead of behaving like an Alpha Matte.
- Animated layer opacity, transition opacity, and parent/group compositor opacity no longer fade or disable the clipping region, including at 0% opacity.
- Preserved intrinsic image transparency and anti-aliased text/shape edges so the clipping boundary remains smooth and follows the actual artwork geometry.
- Separated clipping-shape textures from ordinary matte/artwork textures in the GPU cache. A visible clipping base still renders with its normal opacity, while its clipping shape remains opacity-independent.
- Applied the same behavior to ordinary layers, nested mattes, grouped layers, and Groups used as clipping sources.
- Development Version 070 is exposed through the editor title, dock/About UI, build metadata, and plugin log.

## Development Version 069 — Clipping Matte Artwork Visibility Fix

- Fixed **Clipping Matte** sources ignoring the three-state matte visibility control.
- **Hidden artwork, active as matte** now keeps the clipping source fully functional as the target mask without compositing the source artwork into the frame.
- **Visible artwork and active as matte** continues to composite the clipping source once as the base beneath the linked clipped target.
- The behavior is identical for root layers, grouped children, and Groups used as clipping sources.
- Development Version 069 is exposed through the editor title, dock/About UI, build metadata, and plugin log.

## Development Version 068 — Clipping Matte Composition and Toggle-State Fix

- Fixed **Clipping Matte** so the matte source is composited once as the visible base immediately before the first linked clipping target, independent of either layer's position in the stack.
- The linked target is then alpha-clipped against the completed matte source, including Group matte sources and Group targets.
- Fixed the Alpha/Luma/Clipping type toggle leaking `VisibleAndMatte` state after passing through Clipping. Alpha and Luma now resume correctly immediately, without disabling and re-enabling the target.
- Multiple layers may share one clipping source without repeatedly compositing the base layer.
- Development Version 068 is exposed through the editor title, dock/About UI, build metadata and plugin log.

## Development Version 066 — Group as Track Matte Source Fix

- Fixed the asymmetric GPU matte path where rendering a Group matte reused and overwrote the target layer's shared foreground texture before masking.
- Group matte sources now preserve the consumer texture, composite all descendants, publish the completed Group matte, and only then apply alpha/luma masking.
- The same protected path is used for normal layers, grouped children, adjustment coverage and affect-behind silhouettes.
- Development Version 066 is exposed through the editor title, dock/About UI, build metadata and plugin log.

## Development Version 064 — Group Target Matte GPU Feedback Fix

- Fixed a GPU read/write feedback hazard when a matted group result reused the shared mask render target after one of its children had already been masked.
- Mask inputs are now snapshotted into independent full-canvas textures whenever they alias the destination mask target, so the completed group can be masked reliably.
- The protection applies to group targets, child mattes and nested matte chains without changing the already-working group-as-matte-source path.
- Group effect order continues to follow the existing `Effects -> Matte` / `Matte -> Effects` setting.
- Development Version 064 is exposed through the editor title, dock/About UI, build metadata and plugin log.


## Development Version 059 — Unified Gradient Preset Swatches

- Qt 6 dialog capture compile fix: gradient preset naming now captures the popup by reference, avoiding const-parent conversion and deleted `QDialog` copy-constructor errors.

Gradient presets now use one persistent library across the entire editor. The Gradient Styles dock and every fill/stroke gradient popup display the same compact, color-swatch-style previews, including gradient type, opacity, intermediate stops, spread, angle, and transparency. Presets can be created directly from the active shape fill, text fill, layer stroke, or inline rich-text fill/stroke; applying a swatch immediately updates the current target. User presets can also be removed from the swatch context menu, while built-in presets remain protected. Changes are synchronized live between open editor surfaces, and import/export continues to use the shared Styles library.

## Development Version 057 — Refined Group Editing, Independent Parenting, and Matte Controls

Group and parenting workflows are now clearly separated: transform parenting no longer creates or modifies Groups, while parent/unparent operations preserve the layer's world-space appearance. Newly created Groups start collapsed, collapsed or keyframe-only Groups behave as single selectable containers, and fully expanded Groups expose their children for direct canvas and Effects-panel editing. Child effect stacks continue to render correctly inside Groups, including mask-aware ordering and affect-behind compositing. The update also prevents parents and Groups from snapping to their own descendants, adds three-state track-matte visibility, introduces three-state Group timeline expansion, aligns hierarchy-aware layer-list columns, and standardizes Parent and Matte selectors with numbered layer names.

## Development Version 128 — Auto Styling Merge API Compile Fix

- Declares `rich_text_auto_style_rules_equivalent` and `rich_text_merge_auto_style_rules` in the public rich-text header.
- Fixes the MSVC C3861 errors in `property-synchronization.inc` when loading, appending, or learning rules.
- Keeps rule merging and deduplication in the canonical rich-text model instead of duplicating logic in the properties panel.

## Development Version 127 — Rule Deduplication and Smart Generalization

- Prevents duplicate learned rules and duplicate rules during rule-set Append/Replace loading.
- Promotes equivalent examples to one reusable all-matches rule instead of creating repeated entries.
- Adds per-rule generalization policy: Smart merge, Exact structure only, or Always keep separate.
- Adds explicit duplicate-prevention and multiple-case application controls in Advanced options.
- Persists the new controls in title JSON and portable `.gsp-auto-style.json` rule sets.

## Development Version 126 — Smart Text Analysis and Learned Styles

- Generalizes formatted examples into semantic rules for time, date, numbers, email addresses and URLs.
- Infers fields at paragraph starts, between delimiters and after structural separators.
- Learned rules carry a complete inline style snapshot, so fill, stroke, font and other formatting remain portable without an existing preset.
- Added Clear All Rules actions to the main Auto Styling panel and Rule Editor, with destructive-action confirmation.

## Development version 145 — Audio Layer Data Model
- Added migration-safe `LayerType::Audio` and serializable audio clip properties.
- Added audio import for WAV, FLAC, MP3, AAC/M4A and video containers with audio streams.
- Added timeline waveform rendering, trim-safe clip timing, grouping/duplicate compatibility, and missing-media-safe loading.
- Audio layers do not expose visual transform/keyframe rows.

## Development version 146 — Audio Playback and OBS Integration

- Declared the BGL title source as an OBS audio-capable, controllable media source.
- Added a per-source asynchronous audio decode/cache runtime; decoding never runs in the render callback.
- Routed mixed stereo PCM through `obs_source_output_audio`, preserving OBS mixer volume, mute, monitoring, filters and routing.
- Added synchronized title-playhead transport and independent audio clocks, pause/resume continuity, immediate seek, looping, pan, gain and fades.
- Added OBS media-control callbacks for play, pause, restart, stop, seek, duration, current time and state.
- Added optional FFmpeg decoding for FLAC, MP3, AAC/M4A and audio streams in video containers, with a dependency-free PCM WAV fallback.
- Missing or undecodable media remains silent without crashing or repeatedly resetting the stream.
