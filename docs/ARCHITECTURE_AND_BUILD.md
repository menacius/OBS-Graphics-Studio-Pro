# Architecture and build

## Source ownership

Broadcast Graphics Live keeps public source paths stable while large implementation units are divided into ordered ownership-oriented `.inc` modules. The facade translation units preserve private symbol ordering and anonymous namespaces while making navigation manageable.

Major facades include:

| Facade | Ownership |
| --- | --- |
| `src/obs/title-source.cpp` | OBS source lifecycle, playback, cache presentation, masks, groups, effects, and registration. |
| `src/editor/title-editor.cpp` | Window/session lifecycle, commands, panels, document editing, playback, templates, and signals. |
| `src/canvas/canvas-preview.cpp` | Geometry, selection, snapping, tools, input, overlays, and preview rendering. |
| `src/editor/properties-panel.cpp` | Inspector construction, text/shape/image properties, gradients, and synchronization. |
| `src/editor/title-dock.cpp` | Title management, import/export, cue rows, playlists, cache status, and dock actions. |
| `src/cache/cache-manager.cpp` | Cache identity, storage, invalidation, queueing, workers, and publication. |

The machine-readable module inventory lives at `tools/modular-source-map.json` and is validated by `tools/audit_modularity_performance.py`.

        Rendering and OBS integration
```

Core serialization must not depend on Qt widgets. OBS source code must not depend on editor widgets. Shared algorithms belong in core, text, effects, layers, rendering, or cache modules rather than being copied between editor and source paths.

## Configure and build

The project requires a matching OBS/libobs development package and Qt toolchain. CMake configuration fails intentionally when `libobsConfig.cmake` cannot be found.

### Windows

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-windows.ps1
```

The script discovers configured SDK paths, builds the plugin, stages runtime dependencies, copies locale/icon/effect data, and creates a versioned ZIP.

### Linux/WSL

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-ubuntu-wsl.ps1
```

Build against the same ABI, glibc baseline, Qt version, and packaging environment used by the target OBS distribution. Avoid producing a binary against a newer libc than the target OBS runtime.

### Incremental update/build/package

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\update-and-build.ps1
```

Configuration values can be stored in the adjacent JSON config files instead of hardcoding local paths in scripts.

## Data and packaging

CMake stages locale files, all SVG icons, and effect/transition data into the OBS plugin data directory. Windows dependency DLLs are copied beside the plugin binary. Build trees, staged packages, archives, IDE state, caches, and generated artifacts are excluded by `.gitignore`.

## Tests and audits

- `tests/` contains C++ source-contract tests.
- `tools/` contains Python audits for architecture, build/version consistency, rendering contracts, and specific regressions.
- `cmake/ci/` documents CI-oriented configuration.

When a canonical document path changes, update audits to read the new document instead of retaining a duplicate historical note.

## Contribution rules

- Add code to the owning module rather than the facade.
- Keep UI-only state out of title serialization.
- Keep project data out of global `QSettings`.
- Preserve editor/source rendering parity.
- Add a focused regression contract for compile fixes and model-order changes.
- Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and the relevant thematic document rather than adding a new one-off markdown file.
## External-data runtime ownership

`src/core/external-data-types.h` contains the provider-neutral serialized schema and layer binding model. `src/core/external-data.cpp` owns mutable runtime source state and is the only component that accepts provider updates. `src/core/external-data-provider.cpp` owns provider lifecycles, parsing, file access, polling timers, HTTP requests, and WebSocket reconnects on one dedicated Qt worker thread. Provider code submits typed values to the manager; it never mutates `Layer` authored fields or touches GPU objects.

`src/editor/external-data-settings-dialog.cpp` edits provider definitions and pending layer bindings. Runtime Connect/Refresh actions can preview a configuration, while Save is the only path that commits bindings to the title; Cancel resynchronizes the provider service from the authoritative title store.

A changed value publishes a runtime-only revision, editor callback, and coalesced render-queue entry. OBS consumes pending entries from its source tick/render path and resolves effective values from a mutex-protected snapshot. Equal values are acknowledged by timestamp only and intentionally produce no callbacks or cache invalidation.

## Serialization and migration

The title store remains a top-level JSON array. Titles carry explicit schema and development metadata, and the migration ledger is contiguous from Development Version 144 onward, including deliberate no-op steps. Migration and current-schema validation are idempotent. Malformed titles or child entries recover independently; unknown future fields are retained by the JSON migration layer where possible; missing audio, proxy, provider, or extension resources fail softly instead of discarding the document. Existing non-empty layer IDs are preserved.

Persisted coverage includes external data and Live Text table bindings, rich-text formatting and patterns, audio layers and effects, Stinger settings and Scene A/B inputs, proxy metadata, spatial/temporal Bezier handles, groups, and dock state. Runtime provider values, audio decoder state, monitor state, worker queues, and cache residency are not serialized as authored document data.

## Regression coverage

Automated contracts cover source structure, serialization round trips, cache/thread ownership, audio scheduling and reverse transport, external JSON paths, Stinger modes, timeline behavior, effects, shutdown, and package/version consistency. The Python contract runner executes every `tests/*.py` source contract deterministically.

Manual release checks include: Undo/redo, Copy/paste, Group/ungroup, Save/reopen, External JSON, Audio layer pause/resume/seek, Stinger scene transition, cache/prerender, scene masks, Corrupt proxy cache recovery, Dock layout restoration, Windows and Linux parity, and OBS startup/shutdown.
