# OBS Graphics Studio Pro module architecture

This document defines the incremental module split for OBS Graphics Studio Pro. The
first pass moves the existing monolithic files into ownership-oriented source
folders while preserving the legacy include names and runtime behavior. New work
should land in the owning module below instead of expanding editor/source files
without a clear boundary.

## Dependency direction

Keep dependencies flowing downward through stable data contracts:

```text
Editor UI / Docking ─┐
Canvas & Tools ──────┼──> Layer System ─┐
Timeline & Animation ┘                  ├──> Core Architecture
Text Engine ────────────────────────────┘
Effects System ─────> Rendering Engine ───> OBS Integration
Performance & Stability audits observe all modules but should not own features.
```

Rules for future refactors:

- `core` owns project data, serialization formats, title metadata, undo/redo
  state, command contracts, and global state transitions.
- Feature modules may depend on `core` models, but `core` must not depend on UI,
  OBS, rendering, effects, timeline, or tool modules.
- `obs` owns plugin registration and source lifecycle. Editor-only code should
  call into `obs` through narrow interfaces, not by embedding OBS-specific
  rendering or property logic in panels.
- `editor`, `canvas`, and `timeline` own user interaction; they should request
  model changes through commands instead of mutating shared state ad hoc.
- `rendering`, `effects`, and `text` own drawing decisions and cache invalidation
  for their domains. Expensive work should be explicit and measurable.

## Current source ownership

| Module | Current files | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core Architecture | `src/core/title-data.*`, `src/core/title-localization.h` | Title/project ownership, serialization helpers, localization helpers, and data-store state contracts. |
| Layer System | `src/layers/layer-model.h` | Layer type definitions, hierarchy metadata, transforms, masks, visibility/locking flags, and layer-owned defaults. |
| Effects System | `src/effects/layer-effects.h` | Stackable layer effect types, blend modes, and effect parameter contracts. |
| Timeline & Animation | `src/timeline/animation.*` | Keyframes, easing types, animated property contracts, and interpolation evaluation. |
| Text Engine | `src/text/title-rich-text.*` | Rich-text model, mixed inline styles, plain-text conversion, and text serialization helpers. |
| OBS Integration | `src/obs/plugin-main.*`, `src/obs/title-source.*` | OBS module registration, source creation/destruction, source properties, preview/live output, and OBS-facing rendering entry points. |
| Editor UI / Docking | `src/editor/title-dock.*`, `src/editor/title-editor.*`, `src/editor/title-hotkeys.*`, `src/editor/title-assets.h` | Qt dock integration, editor windows, toolbars, properties panels, hotkeys, icons, and layout UI. |

## Target modules for subsequent phases

The following directories are intentionally introduced now so future work has a
clear destination even before all code is extracted from legacy files:

- `src/rendering`: GPU/OBS render paths, Cairo fallback, textures, alpha,
  blending, filters, render caches, invalidation, and performance-critical draw
  code.
- `src/layers`: Text/shape/image/group/mask layer behavior, hierarchy,
  transforms, parenting, visibility, locking, and layer-specific keyframe hooks.
- `src/effects`: Stackable effects such as shadows, glows, color overlays,
  brightness/contrast, saturation, blend modes, effect serialization, and effect
  caches.
- `src/canvas`: Selection, transform handles, snapping, rulers, guides, direct
  manipulation, drawing tools, zoom/pan, and keyboard-routing for canvas tools.
- `src/timeline`: Playback, timecode, animation curves, keyframe selection,
  easing types, and layer animation state.
- `src/performance`: Profiling notes, cache audits, render-time spike analysis,
  memory usage findings, crash-risk reviews, and regression-test plans.

## Incremental migration phases

1. **Source ownership split (completed).** Move existing files into module
   folders and expose those folders in CMake include paths without behavior
   changes.
2. **Model contract extraction (in progress).** Move layer, effects, and timeline
   primitives behind module-owned headers/sources while keeping existing JSON and
   editor behavior stable.
3. **Core contracts.** Extract command/undo interfaces and project metadata from
   `title-data` into smaller core headers and add serialization regression tests.
4. **Rendering extraction.** Move Cairo/OBS drawing helpers out of
   `src/obs/title-source.cpp` and editor paint code into `src/rendering` with
   cache ownership documented at each boundary.
5. **Layer/effects extraction.** Move layer-specific behavior and effect stacks
   into `src/layers` and `src/effects`, keeping serialization in core-facing DTOs.
6. **Canvas/timeline extraction.** Move direct manipulation, shortcuts,
   keyframe UI, playback, and easing logic out of editor widgets into tool and
   timeline services.
7. **Stability pass.** Add regression tests and profiling checkpoints for render
   spikes, cache invalidation, memory ownership, undo/redo consistency, and OBS
   source lifecycle crashes.
